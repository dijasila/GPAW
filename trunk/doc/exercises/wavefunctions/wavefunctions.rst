Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of a CO molecule
========================================

In this section, we will look at the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of the CO
molecule and compare them to results from molecular orbital theory.

* Make a script, where a CO molecule is placed in the center of a cubic
  unit cell with non-periodic boundary conditions, e.g. of 6 Ã…. For
  more accurate calculations, the cell should definitely be bigger,
  but for reasons of speed, we use  this cell here. Which value for the
  grid spacing would you use? Include a couple of unoccupied bands in the
  calculation (what is the number of valence electrons in CO).
  Guess reasonable positions from
  the covalent radii of C and O. Then relax the CO molecule to its
  minimum energy position. Write the relaxation to a trajectory file and
  the final results to a :file:`.gpw` file. The wavefunctions
  are not written to the :file:`.gpw` file by default, but can be saved by
  writing :samp:`{calc}.write('CO.gpw', mode='all')`, where :samp:`{calc}` is
  your calculator object. The trajectory can be viewed by::

    $ ag CO.traj

  Mark the two atoms to see the bond length.

* As this is a calculation of a molecule, one should get integer
  occupation numbers - check this in the text output.  What electronic
  temperature was used?

* Plot the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of the different wave functions of the CO
  molecule. The wavefunctions should be written to :file:`.cube` files for 
  handling with :program:`VMD`. The following lines could be included in a
  script or written directly from the python promt::

    from ase import *
    from gpaw import *
    CO, calc = restart('CO.gpw')
    for n in range(calc.get_number_of_bands()):
        wf = calc.get_pseudo_wave_function(band=n)
        write('CO%d.cube' % n, CO, data=wf)

  You can then load all of the wave functions into :program:`VMD`
  simultaneously, by running :samp:`vmd CO{?}.cube`.  In :program:`VMD` choose 
  :menuselection:`Graphics --> Representations`, click 
  :guilabel:`Create Rep`, then choose 
  :menuselection:`Drawing Method --> isosurface`.  In the 
  :guilabel:`Data Set` field, you can then
  choose between all the saved wave functions.

  What is the highest occupied state and the lowest unoccupied state?

  How does your wave functions compare to a molecular orbital picture?
  Try to Identify :math:`\sigma` and :math:`\pi` orbitals. Which
  wave functions are bonding and which are antibonding?
