r"""This module calculates the orbital magnetic moment vector for each atom.

The orbital magnetic moment is calculated in the atom-centred approximation
where only the PAW correction to the wave function is assumed to contribute.
This leads to the equation (presented in SI units):

::

                 ===
   a         e   \     a    a
  m      = - --  /    D    L
   orb,v     2m  ===   ii'  vii'
                 ii'

with L^a_vii' containing the matrix elements of the angular momentum operator
between two partial waves centred at atom a.

The orbital magnetic moments are returned in units of Î¼_B without the sign of
the negative electronic charge, q = - e.

    """Returns orbital magnetic moment vectors for each atom a
    calculated from its respective atomic density matrix.

    This method assumes that D_asii is on every rank and not parallelised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D_asii : AtomArrays or dictionary
        Atomic density matrix for each atom a. The i-index refers to the
        partial waves of an atom and the s-index refers to 0, x, y, and z.
    n_aj : List of lists of integers
        Principal quantum number for each radial partial wave j
    l_aj : List of lists of integers
        Angular momentum quantum number for each radial partial wave j

    NB: i is an index for all partial waves for one atom and j is an index for
    only the radial wave function which is used to build all of the partial
    waves. i and j do not refer to the same kind of index.

    Only pairs of partial waves with the same radial function may yield
    nonzero contributions. The sum can therefore be limited to diagonal blocks
    of shape [2 * l_j + 1, 2 * l_j + 1] where l_j is the angular momentum
    quantum number of the j'th radial function.

    Partials with unbounded radial functions (negative n_j) are skipped.
