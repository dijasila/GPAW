This is a rewrite based on the original DFPT code, which unfortunately was
never finished.


ToDo:
2. Reduce to minimal code and introduce timers
3. Make it work for arbitrary q, example Si_X
4. Which modes (lcao, fd, pw) and potentials (ah, nc, paw) should it work?
and so on



Done:
0. Start with no symmetry, no parallelization, only pbc
1. Create Si_Gamma example and make dfpt print the phonon energy
