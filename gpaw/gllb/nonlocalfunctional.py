     Non-local functional is a superclass for many different types of functionals. It will give
     it's subclasses ability to use quanities such as density, gradient, wavefunctions and eigenvalues.

     Subclasses will have to override methods get_functional_desc(), which will return
     a NonLocalFunctionalDesc object corresponding to needs of the functional, and
     method calculate_non_local which will do the actual calculation of KS-potential
     using the optional density, gradient, wavefunctions, eigenvalues supplied in info-dictionary.

     Subclasses will have to override the method calculate_non_local which will be supplied
     with items requested by NonLocalFunctionalDesc. NonLocalFunctional will "help" the it's subclasses
     by calculating these items beforehand, so adding different types of functionals will be more
     straightforward. NonLocalFunctional will also perform the potential mixing needed for potentials
     constructed from orbitals, since the mixing is otherwise performed to density only in GPAW.

     NonLocalFunctional handles only 3D-case, so 1D-setup generation must be handled by subclasses.
