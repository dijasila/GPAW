Release notes
=============


Git master branch
=================

:git:`master <>`.

* Broadcast imports (Python3 only): Master process broadcasts most module
  files at import time to reduce file system overhead in parallel
  calculations.

* Command-line arguments for BLACS/ScaLAPACK
  have been
  removed in favour of the :ref:`parallel keyword
  <manual_parallelization_types>`.  For example instead of running
  ``gpaw-python --sl_diagonalize=4,4,64``, set the parallelization
  within the script using
  ``GPAW(parallel={'sl_diagonalize': (4, 4, 64)})``.

* When run through the ordinary Python interpreter, GPAW will now only
  intercept and use command-line options of the form ``--gpaw
  key1=value1,key2=value2,...`` or ``--gpaw=key1=value1,key2=value2,...``.

* ``gpaw-python`` now takes :ref:`command line options` directly
  instead of stealing them from ``sys.argv``, passing the remaining
  ones to the script:
  Example: ``gpaw-python --gpaw=debug=True myscript.py myscript_arguments``.
  See also ``gpaw-python --help``.

* Two new parameters for specifying the Pulay stress. Directly like this::

      GPAW(mode=PW(ecut, pulay_stress=...), ...)

  or indirectly::

      GPAW(mode=PW(ecut, dedecut=...), ...)

  via the formula `\sigma_P=(2/3)E_{\text{cut}}dE/dE_{\text{cut}}/V`.  Use
  ``dedecut='estimate'`` to use an estimate from the kinetic energy of an
  isolated atom.


Version 1.3.0
=============

2 October 2017: :git:`1.3.0 <../1.3.0>`

* Corresponding ASE release: ASE-3.15.0.

* :ref:`command line options` ``--dry-run`` and ``--debug`` have been removed.
  Please use ``--gpaw dry-run=N`` and ``--gpaw debug=True`` instead
  (or ``--gpaw dry-run=N,debug=True`` for both).

* The :meth:`ase.Atoms.get_magnetic_moments` method will no longer be
  scaled to sum up to the total magnetic moment.  Instead, the magnetic
  moments integrated inside the atomic PAW spheres will be returned.

* New *sbatch* sub-command for GPAW's :ref:`cli`.

* Support added for ASE's new *band-structure* :ref:`ase:cli`::

  $ ase band-structure xxx.gpw -p GKLM

* Added :ref:`tetrahedron method <tetrahedron>` for calculation the density
  response function.

* Long-range cutoff for :mod:`~ase.calculators.qmmm` calculations can now be
  per molecule instead of only per point charge.

* Python 2.6 no longer supported.

* There is now a web-page documenting the use of the in development version
  of GPAW: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/dev/.

* :ref:`BSE <bse tutorial>` calculations for spin-polarized systems.

* Calculation of :ref:`magnetic anisotropy <magnetic anisotropy>`.

* Calculation of vectorial magnetic moments inside PAW spheres based on
  spin-orbit spinors.

* Added a simple :func:`gpaw.occupations.occupation_numbers` function for
  calculating occupation numbers, fermi-level, magnetic moment, and entropy
  from eigenvalues and k-point weights.

* Deprecated calculator-keyword ``dtype``.  If you need to force the datatype
  of the wave functions to be complex, then use something like::

      calc = GPAW(mode=PW(ecut=500, force_complex_dtype=True))

* Norm-conserving potentials (HGH and SG15) now subtract the Hartree
  energies of the compensation charges.
  The total energy of an isolated pseudoatom stripped of all valence electrons
  will now be zero.

* HGH and SG15 pseudopotentials are now Fourier-filtered at runtime
  as appropriate for the given grid spacing.  Using them now requires scipy.

* The ``gpaw dos`` sub-command of the :ref:`cli` can now show projected DOS.
  Also, one can now use linear tetrahedron interpolation for the calculation
  of the (P)DOS.

* The :class:`gpaw.utilities.ps2ae.PS2AE` tool can now also calculate the
  all-electron electrostatic potential.


Version 1.2.0
=============

7 February 2017: :git:`1.2.0 <../1.2.0>`.

* Corresponding ASE release: ASE-3.13.0.

* New file-format for gpw-files.  Reading of old files should still work.
  Look inside the new files with::

      $ python3 -m ase.io.ulm abc.gpw

* Simple syntax for specifying BZ paths introduced:
  ``kpts={'path': 'GXK', 'npoints': 50}``.

* Calculations with ``fixdensity=True`` no longer update the Fermi level.

* The GPAW calculator object has a new
  :meth:`~ase.calculators.calculator.Calculator.band_structure`
  method that returns an :class:`ase.dft.band_structure.BandStructure`
  object.  This makes it very easy to create band-structure plots as shown
  in section 9 of this awesome Psi-k *Scientfic Highlight Of The Month*:
  http://psi-k.net/download/highlights/Highlight_134.pdf.

* Dipole-layer corrections for slab calculations can now be done in PW-mode
  also.  See :ref:`dipole`.

* New :meth:`~gpaw.paw.PAW.get_electrostatic_potential` method.

* When setting the default PAW-datasets or basis-sets using a dict, we
  must now use ``'default'`` as the key instead of ``None``:

  >>> calc = GPAW(basis={'default': 'dzp', 'H': 'sz(dzp)'})

  and not:

  >>> calc = GPAW(basis={None: 'dzp', 'H': 'sz(dzp)'})

  (will still work, but you will get a warning).

* New feature added to the GW code to be used with 2D systems. This lowers
  the required k-point grid necessary for convergence. See this tutorial
  :ref:`gw-2D`.

* It is now possible to carry out GW calculations with eigenvalue self-
  consistency in G. See this tutorial :ref:`gw-GW0`.

* XC objects can now be specified as dictionaries, allowing GGAs and MGGAs
  with custom stencils: ``GPAW(xc={'name': 'PBE', 'stencil': 2})``

* Support for spin-polarized vdW-DF functionals (svdW-DF) with libvdwxc.


Version 1.1.0
=============

22 June 2016: :git:`1.1.0 <../1.1.0>`.

* Corresponding ASE release: ASE-3.11.0.

* There was a **BUG** in the recently added spin-orbit module.  Should now
  be fixed.

* The default Davidson eigensolver can now parallelize over bands.

* There is a new PAW-dataset file available:
  :ref:`gpaw-setup-0.9.20000.tar.gz <datasets>`.
  It's identical to the previous
  one except for one new data-file which is needed for doing vdW-DF
  calculations with Python 3.

* Jellium calculations can now be done in plane-wave mode and there is a new
  ``background_charge`` keyword (see the :ref:`Jellium tutorial <jellium>`).

* New band structure unfolding tool and :ref:`tutorial <unfolding tutorial>`.

* The :meth:`~gpaw.calculator.GPAW.get_pseudo_wave_function` method
  has a new keyword:  Use ``periodic=True`` to get the periodic part of the
  wave function.

* New tool for interpolating the pseudo wave functions to a fine real-space
  grids and for adding PAW-corrections in order to obtain all-electron wave
  functions.  See this tutorial: :ref:`ps2ae`.

* New and improved dataset pages (see :ref:`periodic table`).  Now shows
  convergence of absolute and relative energies with respect to plane-wave
  cut-off.

* :ref:`wannier90 interface`.

* Updated MacOSX installation guide for :ref:`homebrew` users.

* topological index


Version 1.0.0
=============

17 March 2016: :git:`1.0.0 <../1.0.0>`.

* Corresponding ASE release: ASE-3.10.0.

* A **BUG** related to use of time-reversal symmetry was found in the
  `G_0W_0` code that was introduced in version 0.11.  This has been `fixed
  now`_ --- *please run your calculations again*.

* New :mod:`gpaw.external` module.

* The gradients of the cavity and the dielectric in the continuum
  solvent model are now calculated analytically for the case of the
  effective potential method. This improves the accuracy of the forces
  in solution compared to the gradient calculated by finite
  differences. The solvation energies are expected to change slightly
  within the accuracy of the model.

* New `f_{\text{xc}}` kernels for correlation energy calculations.  See this
  updated :ref:`tutorial <rapbe_tut>`.

* Correlation energies within the range-separated RPA.  See this
  :ref:`tutorial <rangerpa_tut>`.

* Experimental interface to the libvdwxc_ library
  for efficient van der Waals density functionals.

* It's now possible to use Davidson and CG eigensolvers for MGGA calculations.

* The functional name "M06L" is now deprecated.  Use "M06-L" from now on.

Version 0.11.0
==============

22 July 2015: :git:`0.11.0 <../0.11.0>`.

* Corresponding ASE release: ASE-3.9.1.

* When searching for basis sets, the setup name if any is now
  prepended automatically to the basis name.  Thus if
  :file:`setups='<setupname>'` and :file:`basis='<basisname>'`, GPAW
  will search for :file:`<symbol>.<setupname>.<basisname>.basis`.

* :ref:`Time-propagation TDDFT with LCAO <lcaotddft>`.

* Improved distribution and load balance when calculating atomic XC
  corrections, and in LCAO when calculating atomic corrections to the
  Hamiltonian and overlap.

* Norm-conserving :ref:`SG15 pseudopotentials <manual_setups>` and
  parser for several dialects of the UPF format.

* Non-selfconsistent spin-orbit coupling have been added. See :ref:`tutorial
  <spinorbit>` for examples of band structure calculations with spin-orbit
  coupling.

* Text output from ground-state calculations now list the symmetries found
  and the **k**-points used.  Eigenvalues and occupation numbers are now
  also printed for systems with **k**-points.

* :ref:`GW <gw exercise>`, :ref:`rpa`, and :ref:`response function
  calculation <df_tutorial>` has been rewritten to take advantage of
  symmetry and fast matrix-matrix multiplication (BLAS).

* New :ref:`symmetry <manual_symmetry>` keyword.  Replaces ``usesymm``.

* Use non-symmorphic symmetries: combining fractional translations with
  rotations, reflections and inversion.  Use
  ``symmetry={'symmorphic': False}`` to turn this feature on.

* New :ref:`forces <manual_convergence>` keyword in convergence.  Can
  be used to calculate forces to a given precision.

* Fixed bug in printing work functions for calculations with a
  dipole-correction `<http://listserv.fysik.dtu.dk/pipermail/
  gpaw-users/2015-February/003226.html>`_.

* A :ref:`continuum solvent model <continuum_solvent_model>` was added.

* Corresponding ASE release: ASE-3.8.1

* Default eigensolver is now the Davidson solver.

* Default density mixer parameters have been changed for calculations
  with periodic boundary conditions.  Parameters for that case:
  ``Mixer(0.05, 5, 50)`` (or ``MixerSum(0.05, 5, 50)`` for spin-paired
  calculations.  Old parameters: ``0.1, 3, 50``.

* Default is now ``occupations=FermiDirac(0.1)`` if a
  calculation is periodic in at least one direction,
  and ``FermiDirac(0.0)`` otherwise (before it was 0.1 eV for anything
  with **k**-points, and 0 otherwise).

* Calculations with a plane-wave basis set are now officially supported.

* :ref:`One-shot GW calculations <gw_theory>` with full frequency
  integration or plasmon-pole approximation.

* Beyond RPA-correlation: `using renormalized LDA and PBE
  <https://trac.fysik.dtu.dk/projects/gpaw/browser/branches/sprint2013/doc/tutorials/fxc_correlation>`_.

* :ref:`bse theory`.

* Improved RMM-DIIS eigensolver.

* Support for new libxc 2.0.1.  libxc must now be built separately from GPAW.

* MGGA calculations can be done in plane-wave mode.

  based calculation (except MGGA).

* MGGA: number of neighbor grid points to use for FD stencil for
  wave function gradient changed from 1 to 3.

* New setups: Y, Sb, Xe, Hf, Re, Hg, Tl, Rn

* Non self-consistent calculations with screened hybrid functionals
  (HSE03 and HSE06) can be done in plane-wave mode.

* Modified setups:

  .. note::

     Most of the new semicore setups currently require
     :ref:`eigensolver <manual_eigensolver>` ``dav``, ``cg``
     eigensolvers or ``rmm-diis`` eigensolver with a couple of iterations.

  - improved eggbox: N, O, K, S, Ca, Sc, Zn, Sr, Zr, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, Bi

  - semicore states included: Na, Mg, V, Mn, Ni,
    Nb, Mo, Ru (seems to solve the Ru problem :git:`gpaw/test/big/Ru001/`),
    Rh, Pd, Ag, Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt

  - semicore states removed: Te

  - elements removed: La (energetics was wrong: errors ~1eV per unit cell
    for PBE formation energy of La2O3 wrt. PBE benchmark results)

  .. note::

     For some of the setups one has now a choice of different
     number of valence electrons, e.g.::

       setups={'Ag': '11'}

     See :ref:`manual_setups` and list the contents of :envvar:`GPAW_SETUP_PATH`
     for available setups.

  grid-point factor is now included and the units are now eV**2. The
  new default value is 4.0e-8 eV**2 which is equivalent to the old
  default for a grid spacing of 0.2 Å.

* GPAW should now work also with NumPy 1.6.

* Much improved :ref:`cli` now based on the `new tool`_ in ASE.
