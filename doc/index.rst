GPAW is a density-functional theory (DFT) Python_ code based on the
projector-augmented wave (:ref:`PAW <literature>`) method and the
atomic simulation environment (ASE_).  It uses real-space uniform
grids and multigrid methods, atom-centered basis-functions or plane-waves.
Read more about the :ref:`algorithms` used.
