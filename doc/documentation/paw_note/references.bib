  abstract = {We report a theoretical scheme that enables the calculation of maximally
	localized Wannier functions within the formalism of projector-augmented
	waves (PAW), which also includes the ultrasoft pseudopotential (USPP)
	approach. We give a description of the basic underlying formalism
	and explicitly write out all the required matrix elements using the
	common ingredients of the PAW/USPP theory. We report an implementation
	of the method in a form suitable for accepting the input electronic
	structure from USPP plane-wave DFT simulations. We apply the method
	to the calculation of Wannier functions, dipole moments and spontaneous
	polarizations for a range of test cases. A comparison with norm-conserving
	pseudopotentials is reported as a benchmark.},

  abstract = {We have developed a practical scheme to construct partly occupied,
	maximally localized Wannier functions (WFs) for a wide range of systems.
	We explain and demonstrate how the inclusion of selected unoccupied
	states in the definition of the WFs can improve both their localization
	and symmetry properties. A systematic selection of the relevant unoccupied
	states is achieved by minimizing the spread of the resulting WFs.
	The method is applied to a silicon cluster, a copper crystal, and
	a Cu(100) surface with nitrogen adsorbed. In all cases we demonstrate
	the existence of a set of WFs with particularly good localization
	and symmetry properties, and we show that this set of WFs is characterized
	by a maximal average localization.}
