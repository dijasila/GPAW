\section{Formalism}\label{sec: paw}
By the requirement of orthogonality, the wave functions have very
sharp features close to the core, as all the states are non-zero in
this region. Further out only the valence states are non-zero,
resulting in much smoother wave functions in this region. The
oscillatory behavior in the core regions, requires a very large set of
plane waves, or equivalently a very fine grid, to be described
correctly. One way of solving this problem is the use of
pseudopotentials in which the collective system of nuclei and core
electrons are described by an effective, much smoother, potential.
The KS equations are then solved for the valence electrons only.  The
pseudopotentials are constructed such that the correct scattering
potential is obtained beyond a certain radius from the core. This
method reduces the number of wave functions to be calculated, since
the pseudo potentials only have to be calculated and tabulated once
for each type of atom, so that only calculations on the valence states
are needed. It justifies the neglect of relativistic effects in the KS
equations, since the valence electrons are non-relativistic (the
pseudopotentials describing core states are of course constructed with
full consideration of relativistic effects). The technique also
removes the unwanted singular behavior of the ionic potential at the
lattice points.
\par The drawback of the method is that all information on the full
wave function close to the nuclei is lost. This can influence the
calculation of certain properties, such as hyperfine parameters, and
electric field gradients. Another problem is that one has no before
hand knowledge of when the approximation yields reliable results.
\par A different approach is the augmented-plane-wave method
(APW), in which space is divided into atom-centered augmentation
spheres inside which the wave functions are taken as some
atom-like partial waves, and a bonding region outside the spheres,
where some envelope functions are defined. The partial waves and
envelope functions are then matched at the boundaries of the
spheres.
\par A more general approach is the projector augmented wave method
(PAW) presented here, which offers APW as a special
case\cite{Blochl2003}, and the pseudopotential method as a well
defined approximation\cite{Kresse1999}. The PAW method was first
proposed by Blöchl in 1994\cite{Blochl1994}.

\subsection{The Transformation Operator}\label{sec: transformation operator}
The features of the wave functions, are very different in different
regions of space. In the bonding region it is smooth, but near the
nuclei it displays rapid oscillations, which are very demanding on the
numerical representation of the wave functions.  To address this
problem, we seek a linear transformation $\T$ which takes us from an
auxiliary smooth wave function $\ket{\s{\psi}_n}$ to the true all
electron Kohn-Sham single particle wave function $\ket{\psi_n}$
%
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_n}=\T\ket{\s{\psi}_n}
\end{equation}
%
where $n$ is the quantum state label, containing a $\f{k}$ index, a
band index, and a spin index.
\par This transformation yields the transformed KS equations
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: paw ks equations}
\T^\dagger \Ham \T
\ket{\s{\psi}_n}=\epsilon_n\T^\dagger\T\ket{\s{\psi}_n}
\end{equation}
%
which needs to be solved instead of the usual KS equation. Now we need
to define $\T$ in a suitable way, such that the auxiliary wave
functions obtained from solving \eqref{eq: paw ks equations} becomes
smooth.
\par Since the true wave functions are already smooth at a certain
minimum distance from the core, $\T$ should only modify the wave
function close to the nuclei. We thus define
%
\begin{equation}
\T = 1 + \sum_a \T^a
\end{equation}
%
where $a$ is an atom index, and the atom-centered transformation,
$\T^a$, has no effect outside a certain atom-specific augmentation
region $|\f{r}-\f{R}^a|<r_c^a$. The cut-off radii, $r_c^a$ should
be chosen such that there is no overlap of the augmentation
spheres.
\par Inside the augmentation spheres, we expand the true wave function in the partial waves
$\phi_i^a$, and for each of these partial waves, we define a
corresponding auxiliary smooth partial wave $\s{\phi}_i^a$, and
require that
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: ta}
\ket{\phi_i^a}
=(1+\T^a)\ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
\T^a\ket{\s{\phi}_i^a} =\ket{\phi_i^a} - \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}
\end{equation}
%
for all $i,a$. This completely defines $\T$, given $\phi$ and $\s{\phi}$.
\par Since $\T^a$
should do nothing outside the augmentation sphere, we see from
\eqref{eq: ta} that we must require the partial wave and its
smooth counterpart to be identical outside the augmentation sphere
%
\begin{equation*}
\forall a, \quad \phi_i^a(\f{r})=\s{\phi}_i^a(\f{r})\text{, for } r>r_c^a
\end{equation*}
%
where $\phi_i^a(\f{r})=\braket{\f{r}}{\phi_i^a}$ and likewise for
$\s{\phi}_i^a$.
\par If the smooth partial waves form a complete set inside the
augmentation sphere, we can formally expand the smooth all electron
wave functions as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: smooth psi expansion}
\ket{\s{\psi}_n} = \sum_i P_{ni}^a \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a} \text{, for } |\f{r}-\f{R}^a|<r_c^a
\end{equation}
%
where $P_{ni}^a$ are some, for now, undetermined expansion
coefficients.
\par Since $\ket{\phi_i^a} =
\T\ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}$ we see that the expansion
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: psi expansion}
\ket{\psi_n} = \T\ket{\s{\psi}_n} = \sum_i P_{ni}^a \ket{\phi_i^a} \text{, for } |\f{r}-\f{R}^a|<r_c^a
\end{equation}
%
has identical expansion coefficients, $P_{ni}^a$.
\par As we require $\T$ to be linear, the coefficients $P_{ni}^a$ must be
linear functionals of $\ket{\s{\psi}_n}$, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: P expansion coeff}
P_{ni}^a = \braket{\s{p}_i^a}{\s{\psi}_n} = \int d\f{r}
\s{p}_i^{a*}(\f{r}-\f{R}^a)\s{\psi}_n(\f{r})
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\s{p}_i^a}$ are some fixed functions termed smooth
projector functions.
\par As there is no overlap between the augmentation spheres, we
expect the one center expansion of the smooth all electron wave
function, $\ket{\s{\psi}^a_n} = \sum_i
\ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\braket{\s{p}_i^a}{\s{\psi}_n}$ to reduce to
$\ket{\s{\psi}_n}$ itself inside the augmentation sphere defined by
$a$. Thus, the smooth projector functions must satisfy
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: phi p completeness}
\sum_i \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\bra{\s{p}_i^a} = 1 %\qquad\text{, for }|\f{r}-\f{R}^a|<r_c^a
\end{equation}
%
inside each augmentation sphere. This also implies that
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: phi p orthogonal}
\braket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a}=\delta_{i_1,i_2} \text{~, for } |\f{r}-\f{R}^a|<r_c^a
\end{equation}
%
i.e. the projector functions should be orthonormal to the smooth
partial waves inside the augmentation sphere. There are no
restrictions on $\s{p}_i^a$ outside the augmentation spheres, so
for convenience we might as well define them as local functions,
i.e. $\s{p}_i^a(\f{r})=0$ for $r>r_c^a$.
\par Note that the completeness relation \eqref{eq: phi p
completeness} is equivalent to the requirement that $\s{p}_i^a$
should produce the correct expansion coefficients of \eqref{eq:
smooth psi expansion}-\eqref{eq: psi expansion}, while \eqref{eq:
phi p orthogonal} is merely an implication of this restriction.
Translating \eqref{eq: phi p completeness} to an explicit
restriction on the projector functions is a rather involved
procedure, but according to Blöchl, \cite{Blochl1994}, the most
general form of the projector functions is:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: projector general}
\bra{\s{p}_i^a} = \sum_j
(\{\braket{f_k^a}{\s{\phi}_l^a}\})^{-1}_{ij}\bra{f_j^a}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{f_j^a}$ is any set of linearly independent functions.
The projector functions will be localized if the functions
$\ket{f_j^a}$ are localized.
\par Using the completeness relation \eqref{eq: phi p
completeness}, we see that
%
\begin{equation*}
\T^a =\sum_i \T^a\ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\bra{\s{p}_i^a} = \sum_i
\big(\ket{\phi_i^a} - \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\big) \bra{\s{p}_i^a}
\end{equation*}
%
where the first equality is true in  all of space, since
\eqref{eq: phi p completeness} holds inside the augmentation
spheres and outside $\T^a$ is zero, so anything can be multiplied
with it. The second equality is due to \eqref{eq: ta} (remember
that $\ket{\phi_i^a} - \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}=0$ outside the
augmentation sphere). Thus we conclude that
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: T operator}
\T =1+ \sum_a\sum_i \big(\ket{\phi_i^a} - \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\big)
\bra{\s{p}_i^a}
\end{equation}
%
\par To summarize, we obtain the all electron KS wave function
$\psi_n(\f{r})=\braket{\f{r}}{\psi_n}$ from the transformation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: psi transform in r}
\psi_n(\f{r}) = \s{\psi}_n(\f{r})+\sum_a\sum_i \big( \phi_i^a(\f{r})
- \s{\phi}_i^a(\f{r}) \big)\braket{\s{p}_i^a}{\s{\psi}_n}
\end{equation}
%
where the smooth (and thereby numerically convenient) auxiliary wave
function $\s{\psi}_n(\f{r})$ is obtained by solving the eigenvalue
equation \eqref{eq: paw ks equations}.
% Note that although the double sum has been indicated by a single
% summation symbol, the order of summation must be preserved, since
% the number of states $i$ depends on the nature of the current atom
% (index $a$).
\par The transformation \eqref{eq: psi transform in r} is expressed in
terms of the three components: a) the partial waves $\phi_i^a(\f{r})$,
b) the smooth partial waves $\s{\phi}_i^a(\f{r})$, and c) the smooth
projector functions $\s{p}_i^a(\f{r})$.
\par The restriction on the choice of these sets of functions are: a)
Since the partial- and smooth partial wave functions are used to
expand the all electron wave functions, i.e. are used as atom-specific
basis sets, these must be complete (inside the augmentation spheres).
b) the smooth projector functions must satisfy \eqref{eq: phi p
  completeness}, i.e. be constructed according to \eqref{eq: projector
  general}.  All remaining degrees of freedom are used to make the
expansions converge as fast as possible, and to make the functions
termed `smooth', as smooth as possible. For a specific choice of these
sets of functions, see section \ref{sec: partial wave basis}. As the
partial- and smooth partial waves are merely used as basis sets they
can be chosen as real functions (any imaginary parts of the functions
they expand, are then introduced through the complex expansion
coefficients $P_{ni}^a$).  In the remainder of this document $\phi$
and $\s{\phi}$ will be assumed real.
\par Note that the sets of functions needed to define the transformation are
system independent, and as such they can conveniently be
pre-calculated and tabulated for each element of the periodic
table.
\par For future convenience, we also define the one center expansions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\psi_{n}^a(\f{r}) &= \sum_i \phi_i^a(\f{r})\braket{\s{p}_i^a}{\s{\psi}_n}\\
\s{\psi}_{n}^a(\f{r}) &= \sum_i
\s{\phi}_i^a(\f{r})\braket{\s{p}_i^a}{\s{\psi}_n}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
In terms of these, the all electron KS wave function is
%
\begin{equation}
\psi_n(\f{r})=\s{\psi}_n(\f{r})+\sum_{a} \big(
\psi_{n}^{a}(\f{r}-\f{R}^a) - \s{\psi}_{n}^a(\f{r}-\f{R}^a) \big)
\end{equation}

\par So what have we achieved by this transformation? The trouble of
the original KS wave functions, was that they displayed rapid
oscillations in some parts of space, and smooth behavior in other
parts of space. By the decomposition \eqref{eq: psi transform in r} we
have separated the original wave functions into auxiliary wave
functions which are smooth everywhere and a contribution which
contains rapid oscillations, but only contributes in certain, small,
areas of space. This decomposition is shown on the front page for the
hydrogen molecule. Having separated the different types of waves,
these can be treated individually. The localized atom centered parts,
are indicated by a superscript $a$, and can efficiently be represented
on atom centered radial grids. Smooth functions are indicated by a
tilde \~{}. The delocalized parts (no superscript $a$) are all smooth,
and can thus be represented on coarse Fourier- or real space grids.

\subsection{The Frozen Core Approximation}\label{sec: frozen core}
In the frozen core approximation, it is assumed that the core states
are naturally localized within the augmentation spheres, and that the
core states of the isolated atoms are not changed by the formation of
molecules or solids. Thus the core KS states are identical to the
atomic core states:
%
\begin{wrapfigure}[17]{r}[35pt]{0pt}
\includegraphics[scale=0.56]{Pt}%
\caption{The core states of Platinum}\label{fig: frozen core}%
\end{wrapfigure}
%
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\psi^c_n} = \ket{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}}
\end{equation*}
%
where the index $n$ on the left hand site refers to both a specific
atom, $a$, and an atomic state, $\alpha$.
\par In this approximation only valence states are included in the
expansions of $\ket{\psi_n}$, \eqref{eq: psi expansion}, and
$\ket{\s{\psi}_n}$, \eqref{eq: smooth psi expansion}.
\par Figure \ref{fig: frozen core}, shows the atomic states of
Platinum in its ground state, obtained with an atomic DFT program at
an LDA level, using spherical averaging, i.e. a spin-compensated
calculation, assuming the degenerate occupation 9/10 of all 5d states,
and both of the 6s states half filled. It is seen that at the typical
length of atomic interaction (the indicated cut-off $r_c=2.5$ Bohr is
approximately half the inter-atomic distance in bulk Pt), only the 5d
and 6s states are non-zero.

\subsection{Expectation Values}\label{sec: expectation values}

The expectation value of an operator $\wh{O}$ is, within the frozen
core approximation, given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle \wh{O} \rangle = \sum_n^\text{val} f_n \bra{\psi_n}\wh{O}\ket{\psi_n} + \sum_a \sum_\alpha^\text{core} \bra{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}}\wh{O}\ket{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}}
\end{equation}
%
using that $\bra{\psi_n}\wh{O}\ket{\psi_n} =
\bra{\s{\psi}_n}\T^\dagger \wh{O}\T\ket{\s{\psi}_n}$, and skipping the
state index for notational convenience, we see that
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \bra{\psi}\wh{O}\ket{\psi} &= \bra{\s{\psi} + \sum_a(\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a)} \wh{O} \ket {\s{\psi} + \sum_a(\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a)}\\
&= \bra{\s{\psi}}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi}} + \sum_{aa'} \bra{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a}\wh{O}\ket{\psi^{a'} - \s{\psi}^{a'}} + \sum_a \left(\bra{\s{\psi}}\wh{O}\ket{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a} + \bra{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi}}\right)\\
&= \bra{\s{\psi}}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi}} + \sum_{a}\left( \bra{\psi^a}\wh{O}\ket{\psi^a} - \bra{\s{\psi}^a}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi}^a} \right)\\
& \hspace{48pt}+ \sum_a \left( \bra{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi} - \s{\psi}^a} + \bra{\s{\psi} - \s{\psi}^a}\wh{O}\ket{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a} \right)\\
& \hspace{48pt}+ \sum_{a\neq a'} \bra{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a}\wh{O}\ket{\psi^{a'} - \s{\psi}^{a'}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
For local operators\footnote{Local operator $\wh{O}$: An operator
  which does not correlate separate parts of space, i.e.
  $\bra{\br}\wh{O}\ket{\br'} = 0$ if $\br\neq \br'$.} the last two
lines does not contribute. The first line, because $\ket{\psi^a -
  \s{\psi}^a}$ is only non-zero inside the spheres, while
$\ket{\s{\psi} - \s{\psi}^a}$ is only non-zero outside the spheres.
The second line simply because $\ket{\psi^a - \s{\psi}^a}$ is zero
outside the spheres, so two such states centered on different nuclei
have no overlap (provided that the augmentation spheres do not
overlap).
\par Reintroducing the partial waves in the one-center expansions, we see that
%
\begin{equation}
\sum_n^\text{val} f_n \bra{\psi_{n}^{a}}\wh{O}\ket{\psi_{n}^{a}} = \sum_n^\text{val} f_n \sum_{i_1i_2} \bra{\phi_{i_1}^{a}P^a_{ni_1}} \wh{O} \ket{\phi_{i_2}^{a} P_{ni_2}^{a}} = \sum_{i_1i_2}\bra{\phi_{i_1}^{a}}\wh{O}\ket{\phi_{i_2}^a} \sum_n^\text{val} f_n P_{ni_1}^{a*}P_{ni_2}^a
\end{equation}
%
and likewise for the smooth waves.%: $\sum_n f_n \bra{\s{\psi}_{n}^{a}}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi}_{n}^{a}} = \sum_{i_1i_2}^\text{val} \bra{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^{a}}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a} \sum_n^\text{val}f_n P_{i_1}^{a*}P_{i_2}^a$.
\par Introducing the Hermitian one-center density matrix 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: density matrix}
D_{i_1i_2}^a =\sum_n f_n P_{ni_1}^{a*} P_{ni_2}^{a} = \sum_n f_n
\braket{\s{\psi}_n}{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}
\braket{\s{p}_{i_2}^a}{\s{\psi}_n} 
\end{equation}
%
We conclude that for any local operator $\wh{O}$, the expectation value is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: local exp values}
  \langle \wh{O} \rangle = \sum_n^\text{val} f_n \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\psi}_n} + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \left( \bra{\phi_{i_1}^{a}}\wh{O}\ket{\phi_{i_2}^a} - \bra{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^{a}}\wh{O}\ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a} \right)D_{i_1i_2}^a + \sum_a \sum_\alpha^\text{core} \bra{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}}\wh{O}\ket{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Densities}\label{sec: densities}
The electron density is obviously a very important quantity in
DFT, as all observables in principle are calculated as functionals
of the density. In reality the kinetic energy is calculated as a
functional of the orbitals, and some specific exchange-correlation
functionals also rely on KS-orbitals rather then the density for
their evaluation, but these are still \emph{implicit}
functionals of the density.
\par To obtain the electron density we need to determine the
expectation value of the real-space projection operator
$\ket{\f{r}}\bra{\f{r}}$
%
\begin{equation}
n(\f{r}) = \sum_n f_n \braket{\psi_n}{\f{r}}\braket{\f{r}}{\psi_n} = \sum_n
f_n|\psi_n(\f{r})|^2
\end{equation}
%
where $f_n$ are the occupation numbers.
\par As the real-space projection operator is obviously a local
operator, we can use the results \eqref{eq: local exp values} of the
previous section, and immediately arrive at
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: electron density}
n(\f{r}) = \sum_n^\text{val} f_n |\s{\psi}_n|^2 + \sum_a
\sum_{i_1i_2} \left(\phi_{i_1}^{a} \phi_{i_2}^{a} -
\s{\phi}_{i_1}^{a} \s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a} \right) D_{i_1i_2}^a + \sum_a
\sum_\alpha^\text{core} |\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}|^2
\end{equation}
%
\par To ensure that \eqref{eq: electron density} reproduce the
correct density even though some of the core states are not
strictly localized within the augmentation spheres, a smooth core
density, $\s{n}_c(\f{r})$, is usually constructed, which is
identical to the core density outside the augmentation sphere, and
a smooth continuation inside. Thus the density is typically
evaluated as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: PAW density}
n(\f{r}) = \s{n}(\f{r}) + \sum_a \left( n^a(\f{r}) -
\s{n}^a(\f{r}) \right)
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{subequations}\label{eq: density contributions}
\begin{align}
\s{n}(\f{r})   &= \sum_n^\text{val} f_n |\s{\psi}_n(\f{r})|^2 + \s{n}_c(\f{r})\label{eq: smooth n}\\
n^a(\f{r})     &= \sum_{i_1i_2} D_{i_1i_2}^a \phi_{i_1}^a(\f{r})\phi_{i_2}^{a}(\f{r}) + n_c^a(\f{r})\label{eq: partial n}\\
\s{n}^a(\f{r}) &= \sum_{i_1i_2} D_{i_1i_2}^a \s{\phi}_{i_1}^a(\f{r})\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}(\f{r}) + \s{n}_c^a(\f{r})\label{eq: smooth partial n}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%

\subsection{Total Energies}\label{sec: total energies}
The total energy of the electronic system is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
E[n] = T_s[n]+U_H[n]+V_{ext}[n]+E_{xc}[n]
\end{equation}
%
In this section, the usual energy expression above, is sought
re-expressed in terms of the PAW quantities: the smooth waves and the
auxiliary partial waves.
\par For the local and semi-local functionals, we can utilize
\eqref{eq: local exp values}, while the nonlocal parts needs more
careful consideration.

\subsubsection{The Semi-local Contributions}
\par The kinetic energy functional $T_s = \sum_n f_n \bra{\psi_n}
-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\ket{\psi_n}$ is obviously a (semi-) local
functional, so we can apply \eqref{eq: local exp values} and
immediately arrive at:
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    T_s[\{\psi_n\}] &= \sum_n f_n \bra{\psi_n} -\tfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2\ket{\psi_n}\\
    &= \sum_n^\text{val} f_n \bra{\s{\psi}_n} - \tfrac{1}{2} \nabla^2\ket{\s{\psi}_n} + \sum_a \left(T_c^a + \Delta T_{i_1i_2}^a D^a_{i_1i_2} \right)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
  T_c^a = \sum_\alpha^\text{core} \bra{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}} - \tfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2 \ket{\phi_\alpha^{a,\text{core}}} \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta T_{i_1i_2}^a = \bra{\phi_{i_1}^{a}} - \tfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2\ket{\phi_{i_2}^a} - \bra{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^{a}} - \tfrac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a}
\end{equation}
%
For LDA and GGA type exchange-correlation functionals, $E_{xc}$ is
likewise, per definition, a semi-local functional, such that it can be
expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
  E_{xc}[n] =   E_{xc}[\s{n}] + \sum_a \left( E_{xc}[n^a] - E_{xc}[\s{n}^a] \right)
\end{equation}
%
By virtue of \eqref{eq: partial n}-\eqref{eq: smooth partial n} we can
consider the atomic corrections as functionals of the density matrix
defined in \eqref{eq: density matrix}, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
  E_{xc}[n] =   E_{xc}[\s{n}] + \sum_a \Delta E_{xc}^a[\{D^a_{i_1i_2}\}]
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E_{xc}^a[\{D^a_{i_1i_2}\}] = E_{xc}[n^a] - E_{xc}[\s{n}^a]
\end{equation}
%

\subsubsection{The Nonlocal Contributions}
The Hartree term is both nonlinear and nonlocal, so more care needs to be taken when introducing the PAW transformation for this expression.
\par In the following we will assume that there is no `true' external field, such that $V_\text{ext}[n]$ is only due to the static nuclei, i.e. it is a sum of the classical interaction of the electron density with the static ionic potential, and the electrostatic energy of the nuclei.
\par We define the total classical electrostatic energy functional as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: coulomb energy}
  \begin{split}
    E_C[n] &= U_H[n] + V_\text{ext}[n] = \frac{1}{2} ((n)) + (n|\textstyle\sum_a Z^a) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{a\neq a'} (Z^a | Z^{a'})%\\
%           &= \frac{1}{2}((n+\textstyle\sum_a Z^a)) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_a ((Z^a))
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where the notation (f|g) indicates the Coulomb integral
%
\begin{equation}
(f|g) = \iint d\br d\br' \frac{f^*(\br) g(\br') }{|\br-\br'|}
\end{equation}
%
and I have introduced the short hand notation $((f)) = (f|f)$. In \eqref{eq: coulomb energy}, $Z^a(\br)$ is the charge density of the nucleus at atomic site $a$, which in the classical point approximation is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  Z^a(\br) = -\Z^a\delta(\br-\bR^a)
\end{equation}
%
with $\Z^a$ being the atomic number of the nuclei. As the Hartree energy of a density with non-zero total charge is numerically inconvenient, we introduce the charge neutral total density
%
\begin{equation}
  \rho(\br) = n(\br) + \sum_a Z^a(\br) \quad (= n_\text{electrons} + n_\text{nuclei})
\end{equation}
%
In terms of this, the coulombic energy of the system can be expressed by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: coulomb energy reduced}
  E_C[n] = U_H'[\rho] = \frac{1}{2}((n+{\textstyle\sum_a Z^a}))'
\end{equation}
%
where the prime indicates that one should remember the self-interaction error of the nuclei introduced in the Hartree energy of the total density. This correction is obviously ill defined, and different schemes exist for making this correction. As it turns out, this correction is handled very naturally in the PAW formalism.
\par For now, we will focus on the term $((\rho)) = ((n+\textstyle\sum_a Z^a))$. If one where to directly include the expansion of $n(\br)$ according to \eqref{eq: PAW density}, one would get:
%
\begin{align*}
  ((n+\textstyle\sum_a Z^a)) &= ((\s{n}+\textstyle\sum_a n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a)) \\&= ((\s{n})) + \sum_{aa'}(n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a|n^{a'} - \s{n}^{a'} + Z^{a'}) + 2\sum_a(\s{n}|n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a)
\end{align*}
%
where in the last expression, the first term is the Hartree energy of the smooth electron density, which is numerically problematic because of the nonzero total charge. The second term contains a double summation over all nuclei, which would scale badly with system size, and the last term involves integrations of densities represented on incompatible grids (remember that the one-center densities are represented on radial grids to capture the oscillatory behavior near the nuclei)\footnote{One could separate the terms in other ways, but it is impossible to separate the smooth and the localized terms completely.}. This is clearly not a feasible procedure. To correct these problem we add and subtract some atom centered compensation charges $\s{Z}^a$:
%
\begin{multline*}
  ((n+\textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a + \textstyle\sum_a \left[Z^a - \s{Z}^a\right])) = ((\s{n} + \textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a)) + \sum_{aa'}(n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a - \s{Z}^a|n^{a'} - \s{n}^{a'} + Z^{a'}- \s{Z}^a) \\+ 2\sum_a(\s{n}+\textstyle\sum_{a'}\s{Z}^{a'}|n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a - \s{Z}^a)
\end{multline*}
%
If we define $\s{Z}^a(\br)$ in such a way that $n^a(\br) - \s{n}^a(\br) + Z^a(\br) - \s{Z}^a(\br)$ has no multipole moments, i.e. 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: no multipole}
  \int d\br r^l Y_L(\wh{\br-\bR^a}) (n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a - \s{Z}^a) = 0
\end{equation}
%
for all $a$, the potentials of these densities are zero outside their respective augmentation spheres ($L=(l,m)$ is a collective angular- and magnetic quantum number). Exploiting this feature, the Coulomb integral reduce to
%
\begin{align*}
  ((n+\textstyle\sum_a Z^a)) %&= ((n+\textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a + \textstyle\sum_a Z^a - \s{Z}^a))\\
  &= ((\s{n} + \textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a)) + \sum_{a}((n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a - \s{Z}^a)) + 2\sum_a(\s{n}^a+\s{Z}^a|n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a - \s{Z}^a)\\
%  &= ((\s{n} + \textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a)) + \sum_{a}(n^a + \s{n}^a + Z^a + \s{Z}^a|n^a - \s{n}^a + Z^a - \s{Z}^a)\\
  &= ((\s{n} + \textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a)) + \sum_{a}\left( ((n^a + Z^a)) - ((\s{n}^a + \s{Z}^a)) \right)
\end{align*}
%
where it has been used that inside the augmentation spheres $\s{n} = \s{n}^a$. In this expression, we have circumvented all of the previous problems. None of the terms correlates functions on different grids, there is only a single summation over the atomic sites, and furthermore the only thing that has to be evaluated in the full space is the Hartree energy of $\s{n}(\br) + \sum_a \s{Z}^a(\br)$ which is charge neutral (see eq. \eqref{eq: rhot charge neutral}).
\par Inserting the final expression in \eqref{eq: coulomb energy}, we see that
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
       E_C[n] &=  \frac{1}{2}((\s{n} + {\textstyle\sum_a} \s{Z}^a)) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_a \left(((n^a + Z^a))' - ((\s{n}^a + \s{Z}^a))\right)\\
              &=U_H[\s{\rho}] + \frac{1}{2}\sum_a \left( ((n^a)) + 2(n^a|Z^a) - ((\s{n}^a + \s{Z}^a))\right)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where we have introduced the smooth total density 
%
\begin{equation}
  \s{\rho}(\br) = \s{n} + \sum_a \s{Z}^a(\br)
\end{equation}
%
Note that the problem with the self interaction error of the nuclei
could easily be resolved once it was moved to the atom centered part,
as handling charged densities is not a problem on radial grids.
\par To obtain an explicit expression for the compensation charges, we
make a multipole expansion of $\s{Z}^a(\br)$
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: compensation expansion}
  \s{Z}^a = \sum_L Q_L^a ~\s{g}_L^a(\br)
\end{equation}
%
where $\s{g}_L^a(\br)$ is any smooth function localized within
$|\br-\bR^a|<r_c^a$, satisfying
%
\begin{equation}
  \int d\br r^l Y_L(\wh{\br-\bR^a}) \s{g}_{L'}^a(\br) = \delta_{LL'}
\end{equation}
%
%i.e. which has only one nonzero multipole moment, and that this is unity
\par Plugging the expansion \eqref{eq: compensation expansion} into
equations \eqref{eq: no multipole}, we see that the expansion
coefficients $Q_L^a$ from must be chosen according to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: compensation multipoles}
  Q_L^a = \int d\br r^l Y_L(\hat{\br}) \left(n^a(\br) - \s{n}^a(\br) + Z^a(\br)\right) =\Delta^a\delta_{l,0} + \sum_{i_1i_2}\Delta_{L i_1i_2}^aD_{i_1i_2}^a
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \Delta^a &= \int dr \left(n_c^a(r) - \s{n}_c^a(r)\right) - \Z^a / \sqrt{4\pi}\label{eq: Delta^a}\\
    \Delta_{L i_1i_2}^a &= \int d\br r^l Y_L(\h{\br})[\phi_{i_1}^a(\br)\phi_{i_2}^{a}(\br) - \s{\phi}_{i_1}^a(\br)\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}(\br)]\label{eq: Delta_Lij}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
and it has been used that the core densities are spherical $n_c^a(\br)
= n_c^a(r) Y_{00}(\hat{\br})$ (we consider only closed shell frozen
cores). This completely defines the compensation charges
$\s{Z}^a(\br)$.
\par Note that the special case $l=0$ of \eqref{eq: no multipole}, implies that
%
\begin{align}
\int d\f{r} &\left[ n^a - \s{n}^a +Z^a - \s{Z}^a \right] = 0\nonumber\\
& \Downarrow\nonumber\\
\int d\f{r} &\left[\s{n}(\br) + \sum_a \s{Z}^a(\br) \right] = \int d\f{r} \left[n(\br) + \sum_a Z^a(\br)\right]\nonumber\\
& \Updownarrow\nonumber\\
\int d\br &~\s{\rho}(\br) = \int d\br ~\rho(\br) = 0\label{eq: rhot charge neutral}
\end{align}
%
i.e. that the smooth total density has zero total charge, making the
evaluation of the Hartree energy numerically convenient.
\par In summary, we conclude that the classical coulomb interaction
energy which in the KS formalism was given by $E_C[n] = U_H'[\rho]$,
in the PAW formalism becomes a pure Hartree energy (no
self-interaction correction) of the smooth total density $\s{\rho}$
plus some one-center corrections
%
\begin{equation}
   E_C[n] = U_H[\s{\rho}] + \sum_a \Delta E_C^a[\{D^a_{i_1i_2}\}]
\end{equation}
%
where the corrections
%
\begin{align*}
  \Delta E_C^a[\{D^a_{i_1i_2}\}] &= \tfrac{1}{2} ((n^a)) + (n^a|Z^a) - \tfrac{1}{2} ((\s{n}^a)) - (\s{n}^a| \s{Z}^a) - \tfrac{1}{2} ((\s{Z}^a))\\
  &= \tfrac{1}{2} \left[((n_c^a)) - ((\s{n}_c^a))\right] - \Z^a\int d\br \frac{n_c^a(r)}{r} - \sum_L Q_L^a(\s{n}_c^a|\s{g}_L^a)\\
  &\quad+ \sum_{i_1i_2} D^{a*}_{i_1i_2}\left[ (\phi_{i_1}^a\phi_{i_2}^{a}|n_c^a) - (\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{n}_c^a) - \Z^a\int d\br \frac{\phi_{i_1}^{a}(\br)\phi_{i_2}^{a}(\br)}{r} -\sum_L Q_L^a(\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{g}_L^a)\right] \\
  &\quad+ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} D^{a*}_{i_1i_2}\left[(\phi_{i_1}^a\phi_{i_2}^{a}|\phi_{i_3}^a\phi_{i_4}^{a}) - (\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{\phi}_{i_3}^a\s{\phi}_{i_4}^{a}) \right]D^{a}_{i_3i_4} - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{LL'}Q_L^aQ_{L'}^a (\s{g}_L^a|\s{g}_{L'}^a)
\end{align*}
%
Using that the potential of a spherical harmonic (time some radial
function) is itself a spheical harmonic of the same angular momentum,
we see that $(\s{g}_L^a|\s{g}_{L'}^a) \propto \delta_{LL'}$ and
$(\s{n}_c^a|\s{g}_L^a) \propto \delta_{L0}$. Noteing that $Q_L^a$ by
virtue of \eqref{eq: compensation multipoles} is a functional of the
density matrix, and inserting this, we get
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E_C^a = \Delta C^a + \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2} D^a_{i_1i_2} + \sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} D^{a*}_{i_1i_2} \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} D^a_{i_3i_4}
\end{equation}
%
where
\begin{align}
  \Delta C^a =& \tfrac{1}{2} \left[((n_c^a)) - ((\s{n}_c^a)) - (\Delta^a)^2 ((\s{g}^a_{00}))\right] - \Delta^a (\s{n}_c^a|\s{g}_{00}^a) - \sqrt{4\pi}\Z^a \int dr \frac{n_c^a(r)}{r}\label{eq:coulom tensor 0}\\
  \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2} =& (\phi_{i_1}^a\phi_{i_2}^{a}|n_c^a) - (\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{n}_c^a) - \Z^a\int d\br \frac{\phi_{i_1}^{a}(\br)\phi_{i_2}^{a}(\br)}{r} \nonumber \\
  &- \Delta^a (\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{g}_{00}^a) - \Delta^a_{00,i_1i_2}\Big( \Delta^a (\s{n}_c^a|\s{g}_{00}^a) + ((\s{g}^a_{00})) \Big)\label{eq:coulom tensor 1}\\
  \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} =& \tfrac{1}{2} \left[(\phi_{i_1}^a\phi_{i_2}^{a} | \phi_{i_3}^a\phi_{i_4}^{a}) - (\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{\phi}_{i_3}^a\s{\phi}_{i_4}^{a}) \right] \nonumber\\
  & -\sum_L \left[ \tfrac{1}{2}\Delta^a_{Li_1i_2}(\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{g}_L^a) + \tfrac{1}{2}\Delta^a_{Li_3i_4}(\s{\phi}_{i_3}^a\s{\phi}_{i_4}^{a}|\s{g}_L^a) + \Delta^a_{Li_1i_2}((\s{g}^a_L))\Delta^a_{Li_3i_4} \right]\label{eq:coulom tensor 2}
\end{align}
%
Note that all integrals can be limited to the inside of the
augmentation sphere. For example $(\phi_{i_1}^a\phi_{i_2}^{a}|n_c^a)$
has contributions outside the augmentation sphere, but these are
exactly canceled by the contributions outside the spheres of
$(\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a\s{\phi}_{i_2}^{a}|\s{n}_c^a)$, in which region the
two expressions are identical.
\par The $\Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}$ tensor has been written in a symmetric
form, such that it is invariant under the following symmetry
operations:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq: C symmetry}
  i_1 &\leftrightarrow i_2 &   i_3 &\leftrightarrow i_4 &   i_1i_2 &\leftrightarrow i_3i_4
\end{align}
%
%To arrive at the symmetric form, it has been used that
%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4L}D_{i_1i_2}^{a*} M^a_{i_1i_2L} \Delta^a_{Li_3i_4}D_{i_3i_4}^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4L}\left(M^a_{i_1i_2L} \Delta^a_{Li_3i_4} + M^a_{i_3i_4L} \Delta^a_{Li_1i_2} \right)D_{i_3i_4}^{a}
%\end{equation*}
%
%due to the symmetry of $M$ and $\Delta$, and that the density matrix
%is hermitian.

\subsubsection{Summary}
Summing up all the energy contributions, we see that the Kohn-Sham total energy
%
\begin{equation*}
  E[n] = T_s[\{\psi_n\}] + U_H'[\rho] + E_{xc}[n]
\end{equation*}
% 
can be separated into a part calculated on smooth functions, $\s{E}$,
and some atomic corrections, $\Delta E^a$, involving quantities
localized around the nuclei only.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: PAW energy functional}
E = \s{E} + \sum_a \Delta E^a
\end{equation}
% 
where the smooth part
%
\begin{equation}
  \s{E} = T_s[\{\s{\psi}_n\}] + U_H[\s{\rho}] + E_{xc}[\s{n}]
\end{equation}
%
is the usual energy functional, but evaluated on the smooth functions
$\s{n}$ and $\s{\rho}$ instead of $n$ and $\rho$, and with the soft
compensation charges $\s{Z}^a$ instead of the nuclei charges
$Z^a(\br)$. The corrections are given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E^a = \Delta T_c^a + \Delta C^a + \sum_{i_1i_2} \left(\Delta T^a_{i_1i_2} + \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2}\right) + \sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} D^{a*}_{i_1i_2} \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} D^a_{i_3i_4} + \Delta E_{xc}^a[\{D^a_{i_1i_2}\}]
\end{equation}
%
where $T^a_c$, $\Delta T_{i_1i_2}^a$, $\Delta C_{i_1i_2}^a$, and
$\Delta C_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}^a$ are system independent tensors that can be
pre-calculated and stored for each specie in the periodic table of
elements.
\par Both the Hamiltonian and the forces can be derived from the total
energy functional \eqref{eq: PAW energy functional} as will be shown
in the following two sections.

\subsection{The Transformed Kohn-Sham Equation}
The variational quantity in the PAW formalism is the smooth wave
function $\s{\psi}_n$. From this, all other quantities, such as the
density matrix, the soft compensation charges, the transformation
operator, etc. are determined by various projections of $\s{\psi}_n$
onto the projector functions, and expansions in our chosen basis
functions, the partial and smooth partial waves. To obtain the smooth
wave functions, we need to solve the eigenvalue equation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: transformed KS}
  \wh{\ws{H}} \s{\psi}_n(\br) = \epsilon_n \h{S}\s{\psi}_n(\br)
\end{equation}
%
where the overlap operator $\h{S} = \T^\dagger \T$ and $\wh{\ws{H}} =
\T^\dagger \Ham \T$ is the transformed Hamiltonian.

\subsubsection{Orthogonality}
In the original form, the eigen states of the KS equation where
orthogonal, i.e. $\braket{\psi_n}{\psi_m} = \delta_{nm}$ while in the
transformed version
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq: orthogonality}
  \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\T^\dagger \T\ket{\s{\psi}_m} = \delta_{nm}
\end{equation}
%
i.e. the smooth wave function are only orthogonal with respect to the
weight $\h{S}$.
\par The explicit form of the overlap operator is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: overlap}
  \begin{split}
  \h{S} &= \T^\dagger \T \\
        &= \left(1+\textstyle\sum_a \T^a\right)^\dagger \left(1+\textstyle\sum_a \T^a\right)\\
        &= {1} + \sum_a \left( \T^{a\dagger} + \T^a + \T^{a\dagger}\T^a\right)\\
        &= {1} + \sum_a \Big[\sum_{i_1} \ket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}(\bra{\phi_{i_1}^a} - \bra{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a}) \sum_{i_2} \ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a}\bra{\s{p}_{i_2}^a} + \sum_{i_2} \ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a}\bra{\s{p}_{i_2}^a} \sum_{i_1}(\ket{\phi_{i_1}^a} - \ket{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a})\bra{\s{p}_{i_1}^a} \\
        &\hspace*{20mm} + \sum_{i_1} \ket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}(\bra{\phi_{i_1}^a} - \bra{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a})\sum_{i_2}(\ket{\phi_{i_2}^a} - \ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a})\bra{\s{p}_{i_2}^a}\Big]\\
        &= {1} + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \ket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}(\braket{\phi_{i_1}^a}{\phi_{i_2}^a} - \braket{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a}{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a})\bra{\s{p}_{i_2}^a}\\
        &= {1} + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \ket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}\sqrt{4\pi}\Delta^a_{00,i_1i_2}\bra{\s{p}_{i_2}^a}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
The orthogonality condition \eqref{eq: orthogonality} must be kept in
mind when applying numerical schemes for solving \eqref{eq:
  transformed KS}. For example plane waves are no longer orthogonal,
in the sense that $\bra{\f{G}} \h{S} \ket{\f{G}'} \neq \delta_{\f{G},
  \f{G}'}$.

\subsubsection{The Hamiltonian}
To determine the transformed Hamiltonian, one could apply the
transformation $\wh{\ws{H}} = \T^\dagger \Ham \T$ directly, which
would be straight forward for the local parts of $\Ham$, but to take
advantage of the trick used to determine the total energy of the
nonlocal term ($E_C[n]$), we make use of the relation
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\delta E}{\delta \s{\psi}^*_n(\br)} = f_n \wh{\ws{H}} \s{\psi}_n(\br)
\end{equation}
%
Using this, we get
%
\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta E}{\delta \s{\psi}^*_n(\br)} &= \frac{\delta}{\delta \s{\psi}^*_n(\br)} \left[ T_s[\{\s{\psi}_n\}] + E_{xc}[\s{n}] + U_H[\s{\rho}] + \Delta E^a[\{D^a_{i_1i_2}\}]\right]\\
%
&= \frac{\delta T_s[\{\s{\psi}_n\}]}{\delta \s{\psi}^*_n(\br)} \\
&\quad + \int d\br' \left[ \frac{\delta E_{xc}[\s{n}]}{\delta \s{n}(\br')} + \frac{\delta U_H[\s{\rho}]}{\delta \s{n}(\br')} \right] \frac{\delta \s{n}(\br')}{\delta \s{\psi}^*_n(\br)}\\
&\quad + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \left[\int d\br' \frac{\delta U_H[\s{n} + \textstyle\sum_a \s{Z}^a]}{\delta \s{Z}^a(\br')}\frac{\delta \s{Z}^a(\br')}{\delta D^a_{i_1i_2}} + \frac{\delta \Delta E^a}{\delta D^a_{i_1i_2}} \right]\frac{\delta D^a_{i_1i_2}}{\delta \s{\psi}^*_n(\br)}\\
%
&= f_n (-\tfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2)\psi_n(\br)\\
&\quad + \int d\br' \left[ v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br') + u_H[\s{\rho}](\br') \right] f_n \delta(\br-\br')\s{\psi}_n(\br')\\
&\quad + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \left[\int d\br' u_H[\s{n} + \textstyle\sum_a\s{Z}^a](\br')\sum_L \Delta^a_{Li_1i_2}\s{g}^a_L(\br') + \frac{\delta \Delta E^a}{\delta D^a_{i_1i_2}} \right] f_n\s{p}^a_{i_1}(\br)P^a_{ni_2}
\end{align*}
%
where $v_{xc}[n](\br) = \frac{\delta E_{xc}[n]}{\delta n(\br)}$ is the
usual local (LDA) or semilocal (GGA) exchange correlation potential,
and $u_H[n](\br) = \frac{\delta U_H[n]}{\delta n(\br)} = \int d\br'
\frac{n(\br')}{|\br-\br'|}$ is the usual Hartree potential.
\par From these results, we can write down the transformed Hamiltonian as
%
\begin{equation}
  \wh{\ws{H}} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + u_H[\s{\rho}] + v_{xc}[\s{n}] + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \ket{\s{p}^a_{i_1}} \Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} \bra{\s{p}^a_{i_2}}
\end{equation}
%
where the nonlocal part of the Hamiltonian is given in terms of the tensor
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} &= \sum_L \Delta^a_{Li_1i_2} \int d\br u_H[\s{\rho}](\br)\s{g}^a_L(\br) + \frac{\delta \Delta E^a}{\delta D_{i_1i_2}^a}\\
    &= \sum_L \Delta^a_{Li_1i_2} \int d\br u_H[\s{\rho}](\br)\s{g}^a_L(\br) + \Delta T^a_{i_1i_2} + \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2} + 2\sum_{i_3i_4} \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}D^a_{i_3i_4} + \frac{\delta \Delta E_{xc}}{\delta D^a_{i_1i_2}} 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
Note that to justify taking the derivative with respect to $D$ only,
and not its complex conjugate, the symmetry properties \eqref{eq: C
  symmetry} has been used to get $D^{a*}_{i_1i_2}
\Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}D^a_{i_3i_4} = D^{a}_{i_1i_2}
\Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}D^a_{i_3i_4}$.

\subsection{Forces in PAW}\label{sec: forces}
In the ground state, the forces on each nuclei can be calculated directly from
% 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq: force}
  \begin{split}
    \f{F}^a &= -\frac{dE}{d\bR^a} \\
&= -\frac{\partial E}{\partial \bR^a} - \sum_n\left\{ \frac{\partial E}{\partial \ket{\s{\psi}_n}} \frac{d \ket{\s{\psi}_n}}{d \bR^a} + h.c.\right\}\\
&= -\frac{\partial E}{\partial \bR^a} - \sum_n f_n \epsilon_n \left\{ \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\h{S} \frac{d \ket{\s{\psi}_n}}{d \bR^a} + h.c.\right\}\\
&= -\frac{\partial E}{\partial \bR^a} + \sum_n f_n \epsilon_n \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\frac{d\h{S}}{d\bR^a}\ket{\s{\psi}_n}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where $h.c.$ denotes the hermitian conjugate. To get to the second
line, the chain rule has been applied. The third line follows from the
relation
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial E}{\partial \bra{\s{\psi}_n}} = f_n \wh{\ws{H}} \ket{\s{\psi}_n} = f_n \epsilon_n \h{S} \ket{\s{\psi}_n}
\end{equation}
%
The last line of \eqref{eq: force} is obtained from the following
manipulation of the orthogonality condition \eqref{eq: orthogonality}
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    &\quad \delta_{nm} = \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\h{S}\ket{\s{\psi}_m} \\
    \Rightarrow &\quad 0 = \frac{d}{d\bR^a} \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\h{S}\ket{\s{\psi}_m} = \frac{d\bra{\s{\psi}_n}}{d\bR^a}\h{S}\ket{\s{\psi}_m}  + \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\frac{d\h{S}}{d\bR^a}\ket{\s{\psi}_m} + \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\h{S}\frac{d\ket{\s{\psi}_m}}{d\bR^a}\\
    \Leftrightarrow & \quad \frac{d\bra{\s{\psi}_n}}{d\bR^a}\h{S}\ket{\s{\psi}_m} + h.c. = - \bra{\s{\psi}_n}\frac{d\h{S}}{d\bR^a}\ket{\s{\psi}_m}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
\par From the expression for the overlap operator \eqref{eq: overlap},
it follows that
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\h{S}}{d\bR^a} = \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta S^a_{i_1i_2}\left(\frac{d \ket{\s{p}^a_{i_1}}}{d\bR^a}\bra{\s{p}^a_{i_2}} + h.c. \right)
\end{equation}
%
which, when inserted in \eqref{eq: force}, gives the force expression
%
\begin{equation}
  \f{F}^a = -\frac{\partial E}{\partial \bR^a} + \sum_n f_n \epsilon_n \sum_{i_1i_2}\Delta S^a_{i_1i_2}\left( P^{a*}_{ni_1}\braket{\frac{d \s{p}^a_{i_2}}{d\bR^a}}{\s{\psi}_n} + \braket{\s{\psi}_n}{\frac{d \s{p}^a_{i_1}}{d\bR^a}} P^a_{ni_2}\right)
\end{equation}
%
In the case of standard xc approximations, the dependence of the total
energy on the nuclei coordinates is
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial \bR^a} &= \int d\br' \frac{\delta E}{\delta \s{n}(\br')}\frac{\partial \s{n}(\br')}{\partial \bR^a} + \sum_{i_1i_2} \frac{\partial E}{\partial D^a_{i_1i_2}}\frac{\partial D^a_{i_1i_2}}{\partial \bR^a} + \int d\br' \sum_L \frac{\delta E}{\delta \s{g}^a_L(\br')}\frac{\partial \s{g}^a_L(\br')}{\partial \bR^a}\\
    &=\int d\br' \s{v}_\text{eff}(\br')\frac{\partial \s{n}^a_c(\br')}{\partial \bR^a} + \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta H^a_{i_1i_2}\frac{\partial D^a_{i_1i_2}}{\partial \bR^a} + \int d\br' \sum_L u_H(\br')Q_L\frac{\partial \s{g}^a_L(\br')}{\partial \bR^a}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
giving the force expression
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: force no exx}
  \begin{split}
    \f{F}^a = - &\int d\br' \left\{ \s{v}_\text{eff}(\br')\frac{\partial \s{n}^a_c(\br')}{\partial \bR^a} + u_H(\br')\sum_L Q_L\frac{\partial \s{g}^a_L(\br')}{\partial \bR^a} \right\}\\
    &- \sum_n f_n \sum_{i_1i_2}\left\{\Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} - \epsilon_n\Delta S^a_{i_1i_2}\right\}\left( P^{a*}_{ni_1}\braket{\frac{d \s{p}^a_{i_2}}{d\bR^a}}{\s{\psi}_n} + \braket{\s{\psi}_n}{\frac{d \s{p}^a_{i_1}}{d\bR^a}} P^a_{ni_2}\right)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Summary}\label{sec: summary exx hamiltonian}
The PAW KS equation to be solved is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: PAW HF-KS EVP}
  \wh{\ws{H}} \ket{\s{\psi}_n}= \epsilon_n \h{S} \ket{\s{\psi}_n}
\end{equation}
%
with $\h{S}$, and $\wh{\ws{H}}$ given by
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\wh{S} &= \h{1} + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \ket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}\sqrt{4\pi}\Delta^a_{00,i_1i_2}\bra{\s{p}_{i_2}^a}\\
\wh{\ws{H}} &= -\tfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + u_H[\s{\rho}](\br) + v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br) + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \ket{\s{p}^a_{i_1}} \Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} \bra{\s{p}^a_{i_2}}\label{eq: PAW Hamiltonian summary}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} = \sum_L \Delta^a_{Li_1i_2} \int d\br u_H[\s{\rho}](\br)\s{g}^a_L(\br) + \Delta T^a_{i_1i_2} + \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2} + 2\sum_{i_3i_4} \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}D^a_{i_3i_4} + \frac{\delta \Delta E_{xc}}{\delta D^a_{i_1i_2}}
\end{equation}
%
\par The total energy can then be evaluated by
%
\begin{equation}
  E = T_s[\{\s{\psi}_n\}] + U_H[\s{\rho}] + E_{xc}[\s{n}] + \sum_a \Delta E^a  
\end{equation}
%
with $\Delta E^a$ given by
%
\begin{equation}
 \Delta E^a = T_c^a + \sum_{i_1i_2} \left( \Delta T^a_{i_1i_2} + \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2}\right) D_{i_1i_2}^a + \sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}D_{i_1i_2}^{a*} \Delta C_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}^a D_{i_3i_4}^a + \Delta E_{xc}^a(\{D_{i_1i_2}^a\})
\end{equation}
%
\par Having solved the eigenvalue problem \eqref{eq: PAW HF-KS EVP},
the eigenvalues are known. This can be used to determine, for example,
the kinetic energy of the pseudo wave functions, $T_s[\s{n}]$, without
doing the explicit (and computationally costly) computation. This can
be seen by operating with $\sum_n f_n \bra{\s{\psi}_n}$ on eq.
\eqref{eq: PAW Hamiltonian summary} to get:
%
\begin{equation}
  T_s[\{\s{\psi}_n\}] = \sum_n f_n \epsilon_n - \int d\br [\s{n}(\br) - \s{n}_c(\br)] \left[u_H[\s{\rho}](\br) + v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br)\right] - \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} D^a_{i_1i_2}
\end{equation}

\section{Implementing PAW}\label{sec: implementing}
For an implementation of PAW, one must specify a large number of data
for each chemical element. This constitutes a data set which uniquely
determines how the on-site PAW transformation works, at the site of
the specific atom. For the generation of such data sets, one needs an
atomic DFT program, with which basis sets can be generated. How to
perform DFT calculations efficiently on an isolated atom will be
discussed in the first section of this chapter, and the actual choice
of data set parameters will be discussed in the second. The atomic DFT
program plays the additional role of a small test program, against
which implementations in the full PAW program can be tested.

\subsection{Atoms}
If we consider the Kohn-Sham equation for an isolated atom, (described
by a non spin-dependent Hamiltonian), it is well known that the
eigenstates can be represented by the product
%
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{i\sigma_i}(\br\sigma) = R_j(r) Y_L(\h{\br})\chi_{\sigma_i}(\sigma)
\end{equation}
%
where $R_j$ are real radial function, and $Y_L$ are the (complex
valued) spherical harmonics. $i=(n,l,m)$, $j=(n,l)$, and $L = (l,m)$.
\par Assuming identical filling of all atomic orbitals, i.e. $f_{i
  \sigma} = f_j$, the density becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  n(\br) = \sum_i \sum_{\sigma_i} f_j|\phi_{i\sigma_i}(\br\sigma)|^2 = \sum_j 2 \frac{2l+1}{4\pi} f_j|R_j(r)|^2
\end{equation}
%
where the first factor of 2 comes from the sum over spin, and the
second factor from the sum over the magnetic quantum number using that
%
\begin{equation}
  \sum_m |Y_{lm}|^2 = \frac{2l+1}{4\pi}
\end{equation}
%
\par The identical filling of degenerate states is exact for closed
shell systems, and corresponds to a spherical averaging of the density
for open shell systems.
\par Determining potentials in a spherical coordinate system is
usually done by exploiting the expansion of the Coulomb kernel
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{|\br-\br'|} = \sum_L \frac{4\pi}{2l+1} \frac{r_<^l}{r_>^{l+1}} Y_L^*(\h{\br})Y_L(\h{\br}')
\end{equation}
%
with $r_< = \min(r, r')$ and $r_> = \max(r, r')$. Using this it is
seen that for any density with a known angular dependence, e.g. the
density $R(r) Y_L(\h{\br})$, the potential can be determined by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: radial potential}
  \begin{split}
    v[R(r) Y_L(\h{\br})](\br) &= \int d\br' \frac{R(r') Y_L(\h{\br}')}{|\br - \br'|}\\
    &= \frac{4\pi}{2l+1} Y_L(\h{\br}) \int_0^\infty r'^2dr' R(r') \frac{r_<^l}{r_>^{l+1}}\\
    &= \frac{4\pi}{2l+1} Y_L(\h{\br}) \left[\int_0^r dr' R(r')r'\Big(\frac{r'}{r}\Big)^{l+1} + \int_r^\infty dr' R(r')r'\Big(\frac{r}{r'}\Big)^l \right]
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
if the angular dependence is not a spherical harmonic, one can always
do a multipole expansion, and use the above expression on the
individual terms.
\par In the case of a radial density $n(\br) = n(r)$, the Hartree
potential becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  u_H(r) = \frac{4\pi}{r}\int_0^r dr' n(r')r'^2 + 4\pi\int_r^\infty dr' n(r')r'
\end{equation}
%
A purely radial dependent density also implies that the xc-potential
is a radial function. Using this, the entire KS equation can be
reduced to a 1D problem in $r$, while the angular part is treated
analytically.

\subsubsection{The Radial Kohn-Sham Equation}
For a spherical KS potential, and using that $Y_L$ are eigenstates of
the Laplacian, the KS equation can be reduced to the simpler
one-dimensional second order eigenvalue problem
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: radial KS equation}
  \left[ -\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dr^2} - \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr} + \frac{l(l+1)}{2r^2} + v_s(r)\right]R_j(r) = \epsilon_j R_j(r)
\end{equation}
%
If we introduce the radial wave function $u_j(r)$ defined by
%
\begin{equation}
  r R_j(r) = u_j(r)
\end{equation}
%
the KS equation can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
  u_j''(r)  + \left(2\epsilon_j - 2v_s(r)- \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\right) u_j(r) = 0
\end{equation}
%
which is easily integrated using standard techniques. See e.g. \cite[chapter 6]{Fiolhais2003}.

\subsection{The Atomic Data Set of PAW}\label{sec: partial wave basis}
The very large degree of freedom when choosing the functions defining
the PAW transformation means that the choice varies a great deal
between different implementations. In any actual implementation
expansions are obviously finite, and many numerical considerations
must be made when choosing these basis sets, to ensure fast and
reliable convergence. This section provides an overview of the
information needed for uniquely defining the PAW transformation, and
the level of freedom when choosing the parameters.

\subsubsection*{The Partial Waves}
The basis functions, $\phi_i^a$, for the expansion of
$\ket{\psi_n}$ should be chosen to ensure a fast convergence to
the KS wave function. For this reason we choose the partial waves
as the eigenstates of the Schrödinger equation for the isolated
spin-saturated atoms. Thus the index $i$ is a combination of
main-, angular-, and magnetic quantum number, $(n,l,m)$. And the
explicit form is
%
\begin{equation*}
\phi_i^a(\f{r})=\phi_{nl}^a(r)Y_{lm}(\hat{\f{r}})
\end{equation*}
%
where $\phi_{nl}^a(r)$ are the solutions of the radial KS Schrödinger
equation \eqref{eq: radial KS equation}, and $Y_{lm}$ are the
spherical harmonics. For convenience we choose $\phi_i^a(\f{r})$ to be
real, i.e. we use the real spherical harmonics instead of the complex
valued. This choice of partial waves implies that the smooth partial
waves and the smooth projector functions can also be chosen real, and
as products of some radial functions and the same real spherical
harmonic.
\par Note that including unbound states of the radial KS equation in
the partial waves is not a problem, as the diverging tail is exactly
canceled by the smooth partial waves. In practice we only integrate
the KS equation outward from the origin to the cutoff radius for
unbound states, thus making the energies free parameters. In principle
the same could be done for the bound states, but in \gpaw, the
energies of bound states are fixed by making the inward integration
for these states and doing the usual matching (see e.g. \cite[chapter
6]{Fiolhais2003}), i.e. the energies are chosen as the eigenenergies
of the system.

\subsubsection*{The Smooth Partial Waves}
\par The smooth partial waves $\s{\psi}_i^a(\br)$ are per construction 
identical to the partial waves outside the augmentation sphere. Inside the 
spheres, we can choose them as any smooth continuation. Presently \gpaw~ uses
simple 6'th order polynomials of even powers only (as odd
powers in $r$ results in a kink in the functions at the origin,
i.e. that the first derivatives are not defined at this point), where
the coefficients are used to match the partial waves
smoothly at $r=r_c$. Other codes uses Bessel functions\cite{Kresse1999} or 
Gaussians.

\subsubsection*{The Smooth Projector Functions}
\par The smooth projector functions are a bit more tricky.  Making
them orthonormal to $\s{\phi}_i^a(\f{r})$ is a simple task of applying
an orthonormalization procedure. This is the only formal requirement,
but in any actual implementation all expansions are necessarily
finite, and we therefore want them to converge as fast as possible, so
only a few terms needs to be evaluated.
\par A popular choice is to determine the smooth projector functions
according to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: construct projector}
  \ket{\s{p}_i^a} = \left( -\tfrac{1}{2} \nabla^2 + \s{v}_s - \epsilon_i\right) \ket{\s{\phi}^a_i}
\end{equation}
%
or equivalently
%
\begin{equation}
  \s{p}_{j}^a(r) = \left[-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dr^2} - \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr} + \frac{l(l+1)}{2r^2} + \s{v}_s(r) - \epsilon_j \right] \s{\phi}^a_j(r)
\end{equation}
%
where $\s{v}_s(r)$ is the smooth KS potential $u_H[\s{\rho}](r) +
v_{xc}[\s{n}](r)$. And then enforce the complementary orthogonality
condition $\braket{\s{p}_{j}^a}{\s{\phi}^a_{j'}} = \delta_{j,j'}$
inside the augmentation sphere, e.g. by a standard Gram-Schmidt
procedure. Using this procedure ensures that the reference atom is
described correctly despite the finite number of projectors.

\subsubsection*{The Smooth Compensation Charge Expansion Functions}\label{sec: choosing comp charge}
The smooth compensation charges $\s{g}_L^a(\br)$, are products of
spherical harmonics, and radial functions $\s{g}_l^a(r)$ satisfying
that
%
\begin{equation}
\int d\f{r} r^l Y_L(\hat{\f{r}})\s{g}_{L'}^a(\f{r}) = \delta_{LL'}
\end{equation}
% 
In \gpaw~the radial functions are chosen as generalized Gaussian
according to (here shown for $\bR^a=0$):
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: generalized gaussians}
\s{g}_L^a(\f{r}) = \s{g}_l^a(r) Y_L(\hat{\f{r}})~~,\quad
\s{g}_l^a(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\frac{l!}{(2l+1)!}(4\alpha^a)^{l+3/2}r^le^{-\alpha^ar^2}
\end{equation}
%
where the atom-dependent decay factor $\alpha$ is chosen such that
the charges are localized within the augmentation sphere.
%\par With this choice of compensation charges, the tensors
%$N_{L_1L_2}^a$ and the potential part of the $M_{i_1i_2L}^a$ tensors
%can be evaluated analytically, see \cite{Obara:1986}.

\subsubsection*{The Core- and Smooth Core Densities }
The core density follows directly from the all electron partial waves by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq: core density}
n_c(r) = \sum_i^\text{core} |\phi_i(\br)|^2 = \sum_j^\text{core} 2(2l+1) |\phi_j(r)|^2 / 4\pi
\end{equation}
% 
\par The smooth core densities $\s{n}_c^a(\br)$ are like the smooth
partial waves expanded in a few (two or three) Bessel functions,
Gaussians, polynomials or otherwise, fitted such that it matches the
true core density smoothly at the cut-off radius.

\subsubsection*{The Localized Potential}
An additional freedom in PAW is that for any operator $\wh{L}$,
localized within the augmentation spheres, we can exploit the identity
\eqref{eq: phi p completeness}
%
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \ket{\s{\phi}_i^a}\bra{\s{p}_i^a} = 1 %\qquad\text{, for }|\f{r}-\f{R}^a|<r_c^a
\end{equation}
%
valid within the spheres, to get
%
\begin{equation*}
  \wh{L} = \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} \ket{\s{p}^a_{i_1}}\bra{\s{\phi}_{i_1}^a}\wh{L} \ket{\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a}\bra{\s{p}^a_{i_2}}
\end{equation*}
%
so for any potential $\bar{v}(\br) = \sum_a \bar{v}^a(\br- \bR^a)$
localized within the augmentation spheres (i.e. $\bar{v}^a(\br) = 0$
for $r>r_c^a$) we get the identity
%
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \int d\br \s{n}(\br) \sum_a \bar{v}^a(\br) - \sum_a \int d\br \s{n}^a \bar{v}^a(\br)
\end{equation*}
%
This expression can be used as an `intelligent zero'. Using this, we
can make the replacement of the smooth potential
%
\begin{equation}
  \s{v}_s(\br) = u_H[\s{\rho}](\br) + v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br) \to \s{v}_s(\br) = u_H[\s{\rho}](\br) + v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br) + \bar{v}(\br)  
\end{equation}
%
if we at the same time add 
%
\begin{equation}
  B^a + \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta B^a_{i_1i_2} D^a_{i_1i_2}
\end{equation}
%
to the energy corrections $\Delta E^a$, where
%
\begin{equation}
  B^a = -\int d\br \s{n}_c^a\bar{v}^a(\br) \quad\text{and}\quad \Delta B^a_{i_1i_2} = -\int d\br \s{\phi}^a_{i_1}\s{\phi}^a_{i_2}\bar{v}^a(\br)
\end{equation}
%
This also implies that $B^a_{i_1i_2}$ should be added to $\Delta
H^a_{i_1i_2}$.
\par The advantage of doing this is that the Hartree potential and the
xc-potential might not be optimally smooth close to the nuclei, but if
we define the localized potential properly, the sum of the three
potentials might still be smooth. Thus one can initially evaluate
$u_H[\s{\rho}](\br)$ and $v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br)$ on an extra fine grid,
add $\bar{v}(\br)$ and then restrict the total potential to the coarse
grid again before solving the KS equation.
\par The typical way of constructing the localized potentials
$\bar{v}^a$ is by expanding it in some basis, and then choosing the
coefficients such that the potential $u_H[\s{\rho}](\br) +
v_{xc}[\s{n}](\br) + \bar{v}(\br)$ is optimally smooth at the core for
the reference system.
\par Inclusion of $\bar{v}^a(\br)$ changes the forces on each atom only through the redefinitions of $\s{v}_s(\br)$ and $\Delta H^a_{i_1i_2}$.

\subsubsection*{Summary}
When constructing a data set for a specific atom, one must specify the
following quantities, all defined within the augmentation spheres
only:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\phi_i^a$ from radial KS equation
\item $\s{\phi}_i^a$ by appropriate smooth continuation of $\phi_i^a$
\item $\s{p}_i^a$ from equation \eqref{eq: construct projector}
\item $\s{g}_L^a$ localized within $r<r_c$, and satisfying $\int d\f{r} r^{l'} \s{g}_L^a(\f{r})Y_{L'}(\wh{\br - \bR^a}) = \delta_{LL'}$
\item $n_c^a$ follows from $\phi_i^a$ by \eqref{eq: core density}
\item $\s{n}_c^a$ by appropriate smooth continuation of $n_c^a$
\item $\bar{v}^a$ localized within $r<r_c^a$, otherwise freely chosen to make $\s{v}_s$ optimally smooth for the reference system
\end{enumerate}
%
The adjustable parameters besides the shape of $\s{\phi}^a$,
$\s{g}_L^a$, $\bar{v}^a$, and $\s{n}_c^a$ are
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cut-off radii $r_c^a$ (which can also depend on $i$)
\item Frozen core states
\item Number of basis set functions (range of index $i$ on $\phi_i^a$,
  $\s{\phi}_i^a$, and $\s{p}_i^a$)
\item Energies of unbound partial waves
\end{enumerate}
%
Choosing these parameters in such a way that the basis is sufficient
for the description of all possible environments for the specific
chemical element, while still ensuring a smooth pseudo wave function
is a delicate procedure, although the optimal parameter choice is more
stable than for e.g. norm conserving or ultra soft pseudopotentials.
\par Once the quantities above have been constructed, all other
ingredients of the PAW transformation follows, such as $\Delta^a$,
$\Delta_{Lii'}^a$, $T_c^a$, $\Delta T^a_{i_1i_2}$, $\Delta C^a$,
$\Delta C^a_{i_1i_2}$, $\Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}$, $\Delta
\bar{v}^a$, and $\Delta \bar{v}^a_{i_1i_2}$.  The first two are needed
for the construction of the compensation charges and the overlap
operator, and the rest for determining the Hamiltonian, and for
evaluating the total energy.

\section{Non-standard Quantities}
The preceeding sections have described the details of making a
standard DFT scheme work within the PAW formalism. This section will
focus on what the PAW transform does to quantities needed for
post-processing or expansions to DFT.

\subsection{The External Potential in PAW}
The energy associated with the external potential $v_\ext(\br)$ is
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    E_\ext &= \int d\br n(\br) v_\ext(\br)\\
    &= \int d\br \s{n}(\br)v_\ext(\br) + \sum_a \int d\br \left[n^a(\br) - \s{n}^a(\br)\right]v_\ext(\br)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
I.e. we must add the pseudo energy contribution
%
\begin{equation*}
  \s{E}_\ext = \int d\br \s{n}(\br)v_\ext(\br)
\end{equation*}
%
and the atomic corrections:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta E_\ext^a = \int d\br \left[n^a(\br) - \s{n}^a(\br)\right]v_\ext(\br)
\end{equation*}
%
to the total energy.
\par In PAW, the Hamiltonian has the structure:
%
\begin{equation*}
  H = \frac{1}{f_n\ket{\psi_n}}\frac{\partial E}{\partial \bra{\psi_n}} = \s{H} + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2}\ket{\s{p}^a_{i_1}}\Delta H^a_{i_1i_2} \bra{\s{p}^a_{i_2}}
\end{equation*}
%
In our case, the extra contributions due to the external potential are:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \s{H}_\ext(\br) = v_\ext(\br)
\end{equation*}
%
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq: atomic hamiltonian}
  \Delta H^{a,\ext}_{i_1i_2} = \int d\br v_\ext(\br) \left\{\phi_{i1}^a(\br)\phi_{i2}^a(\br) - \s{\phi}_{i1}^a(\br)\s{\phi}_{i2}^a(\br)\right\}
\end{equation}
%
Thus we can write the atomic energy contribution as:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta E^a_\ext &= \int d\br v_\ext(\br)\left[n_c^a(\br)-\s{n}_c^a(\br) + \sum_{i_1i_2}D^a_{i_1i_2}\left\{\phi_{i1}^a(\br)\phi_{i2}^a(\br) - \s{\phi}_{i1}^a(\br)\s{\phi}_{i2}^a(\br)\right\}\right]\\
    &= \int d\br v_\ext(\br)\left[n_c^a(\br)-\s{n}_c^a(\br)\right] + \sum_{i_1i_2}D^a_{i_1i_2}\Delta H^{a,\ext}_{i_1i_2}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
Computing all the elements of \eqref{eq: atomic hamiltonian} can be
time-consuming, as the external potential has to be expanded in som
radial function at each nuclei. Making the assumption
%
\begin{equation*}
  v_\ext(\br) \approx v_\ext(\bR^a) \text{ , for } |\br-\bR^a| < r_c^a
\end{equation*}
%
We can reuse existing matrix elements from the expansion coefficients
of the compensation charges, to get:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta E^a_\ext &= v_\ext(\bR^a) (\sqrt{4\pi} Q_{00}^a + \mathcal{Z}^a)\\
    \Delta H^{a,\ext}_{i_1i_2} &= v_\ext(\bR^a) \sqrt{4\pi} \Delta_{00, i_1i_2}^a
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%

\subsection{All-electron Density}
The atom projected density matrix, is formed by summing the projection
coefficients
\begin{equation*}
  D^a_{i_1i_2} = \sum_n P^a_{ni_1} f_n P^{a*}_{ni_2}.
\end{equation*}

From the pseudo density and the atom projected density matrix, it is
formally easy to reconstruct the true all-electron density via.
\begin{equation*}
  n(\br) = \tilde{n}(\br) + \sum_a \left[ n_c^a(\br) + \sum_{i_1i_2} D_{i_1i_2}^a \left( \phi_{i_1}^a(\br)\phi_{i_2}^a(\br) - \s{\phi}_{i_1}^a(\br)\s{\phi}_{i_2}^a(\br) \right)\right].
\end{equation*}
For some analasis purposes (e.g. plotting) it is desirable to
represent this density on a single regular grid. This however,
re-introduces the problem of transfering sharply peaked atomic
orbitals from the radial grid, to the uniform grid. In gpaw, this is
done by interpolating the pseudo density to an extra fine grid ($4^3$
or $8^3$ times more grid points), summing up the atomic corrections on
the radial grid, and finally using a spline interpolation scheme
to transfer the summed radial correction to the uniform 3D grid. For
some purposes, like e.g. Bader analysis\cite{Tang2008}, it is
desirable that the electron density integrates to a proper number. To
achieve this property, one can choose to adjust the value of the
atomic correction on the grid point closest to the nucleus, such that
the correction integrates to the same value on both the radial and the
uniform grid. This will obviously not affect the location of the
dividing surfaces found by the Bader algorithm, and due to the
exponential nature of the density close to the nuclei, this will
not affect the location of the maxima in practice.

\subsection{Local Properties}
This section describes quantities that can somehow be related to a
specific atom. As the PAW transform utilizes an inherent partitioning
of space into atomic regions, such quantities are usually readily
extractable from already determined atomic attributes, such as the
density matrices or the projector overlaps.

\subsubsection{Projected Density of States}
The projection of the all electron wave functions onto the all
electron partial waves, (i.e. the all electron wave functions of the
isolated atoms) $\phi_i^a$, is within the PAW formalism given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle \phi^a_i | \psi_n\rangle = \langle \tilde \phi^a_i | \tilde \psi_n \rangle + \sum_{a'} \sum_{i_1i_2} \langle \tilde \phi^a_i | \tilde p_{i_1}^{a'} \rangle \Big(\langle \phi_{i_1}^{a'} | \phi_{i_2}^{a'} \rangle - \langle \tilde \phi_{i_1}^{a'} | \tilde  \phi_{i_2}^{a'}\rangle \Big)\langle \tilde p^{a'}_{i_2} | \tilde  \psi_n \rangle
\end{equation}
%
Using that projectors and pseudo partial waves form a complete basis
within the augmentation spheres, this can be re-expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle \phi^a_i | \psi_n \rangle = P^a_{ni} + \sum_{a' \neq a} \sum_{i_1i_2} \langle \tilde \phi^a_i | \tilde p^{a'}_{i_1} \rangle \Delta S^{a'}_{i_1i_2} P^{a'}_{ni_2}
\end{equation}
%
if the chosen orbital index `i` correspond to a bound state, the
overlaps $\langle \tilde \phi^a_i | \tilde p^{a'}_{i_1} \rangle$,
$a'\neq a$ will be small, and we see that we can approximate
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle \phi^a_i | \psi_n \rangle \approx \langle \tilde p_i^a | \tilde \psi_n \rangle
\end{equation}
%
The coefficients $P_{ni}^a = \braket{\s{p}_i^a}{\s{\psi}_n}$, can thus
be used as a qualitative measure of the local character of the true
all electron wave functions. As the coefficients are already
calculated and used in the SCF cycle, it involves no extra
computational cost to determine quantities related directly to these.

These can be used to define an atomic orbital projected density of states
%
\begin{equation}
  n_i(\varepsilon) = \sum_n \delta(\varepsilon - \epsilon_n) \left|P^a_{ni}\right|^2.
\end{equation}
%

\subsubsection{Local Magnetic Moments}
As the projection coefficients are simultaneous expansion coefficients
of the pseudo and the all-electron wave functions inside the
augmentation spheres, it can be seen that inside these, the
all-electron density is given by (for a complete set of partial waves)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atom_density}
  n(\br) = \sum_{i_1i_2} D_{i_1i_2}^a \phi_{i_1}^a(\br)\phi_{i_2}^a(\br) + n_c^a(\br)~, \quad |\br - \bR^a| < r_c^a.
\end{equation}

This can be used to assign a local magnetic moment to each atom acording to
\begin{equation*}
  M^a = \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta S^a_{i_1i_2} \left[ D^a_{i_1i_2}(\uparrow) - D^a_{i_1i_2}(\downarrow) \right].
\end{equation*}
Note that this will not add up to the total magnetic moment $\int d\br
(n_\uparrow(\br) - n_\downarrow(\br))$, due to the interstitial space
between augmentation spheres, and must be scaled if this is desired.

\subsubsection{LDA + U}
The atom projected density matrix $D^a_{i_1i_2}$ can also be used to
do LDA + U calculations. The gpaw implementation follows the LDA + U
implementation in VASP\cite{Rohrbach2004}, which is based on the
particular branch of LDA + U suggested by Dudarev \emph{et
  al.}\cite{Dudarev1998}, where you set the effective (U-J) parameter.
The key notion is that from \eqref{eq:atom_density} one can define an
(valence-) orbital density matrix
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{\rho}_{i_1i_2}^a = \ket{\phi_{i_1}^a} D^a_{i_1i_2} \bra{\phi_{i_2}^a}.
\end{equation*}
Thus doing LDA + U is a simple matter of picking out the d-type
elements of $D^a$, and adding to the total energy the contribution
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hubbard energy}
  \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2}^\text{d type}\frac{U}{2} \tr \left(D^a_{i_1i_2} - \sum_{i_3} D^a_{i_1i_3} D^a_{i_3i_2} \right)
\end{equation}
and adding the gradient of this to the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hubbard hamiltonian}
  \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2}^\text{d type}\ket{\s{p}_{i_1}^a} \frac{U}{2} \left( \delta_{i_1i_2} - 2 D^a_{i_1i_2} \right)\bra{\s{p}_{i_1}^a}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Coulomb Integrals}
Coulomb integrals are quantities of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coulomb integrals}
  V_{n_1n_2n_3n_4} = \iint d\br d\br' \frac{\psi_{n_1}^*(\br)\psi_{n_2}^*(\br')\psi_{n_3}(\br)\psi_{n_4}(\br')}{|\br - \br'} = (n_{n_3n_1}|n_{n_2n_4})
\end{equation}
where the orbital pair density $n_{nn'}(\br) =
\psi_n^*(\br)\psi_{n'}(\br)$ has been introduced. Note that these pair
`densities' doesn't correspond to any physical quantity, and that they
are complex in general.
\par Coulomb integrals are a central ingredient in many-body
perturbation approches to the electronic structure problem, e.g. GW,
and is also used in linear response time-dependent density-functional
theory\cite{Walter2008}.
\par Inserting the PAW expansion in the pair density gives
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pair density}
  n_{nn'}(\br) = \s{n}_{nn'}(\br) + \sum_a \left( n^a_{nn'}(\br) - \s{n}^a_{nn'}(\br) \right)
\end{equation}
with the obvious definitions
\begin{align}
  \s{n}_{nn'} =& \s{\psi}_n^*\s{\psi}_{n'} & n^a_{nn'} = & \sum_{i_1i_2} P^{a*}_{ni_1} P^{a}_{n'i_2} \phi^{a*}_{i_1} \phi^{a*}_{i_2} & \s{n}^a_{nn'} = & \sum_{i_1i_2} P^{a*}_{ni_1} P^{a}_{n'i_2} \s{\phi}^{a*}_{i_1} \s{\phi}^{a*}_{i_2}
\end{align}
\par Exactly like with the Hartree potential, inserting \eqref{eq:pair
  density} directly in \eqref{eq:coulomb integrals} would lead to
undesired terms, like overlaps of different augmentation spheres, and
of densities on incompatible grids. The cure is the same; a
compensation charge is introduced
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pair density with Z}
  n_{nn'}(\br) = \s{\rho}_{nn'}(\br) + \sum_a \left( n^a_{nn'}(\br) - \s{n}^a_{nn'}(\br) - \s{Z}^a_{nn'}(\br)\right)
\end{equation}
with the compensated pair density given by
\begin{equation}
  \s{\rho}_{nn'}(\br) = \s{n}_{nn'}(\br) + \sum_a \s{Z}^a_{nn'}(\br)
\end{equation}
As with the compensation charges of the Hartree potential, the
compensation charges, $\s{Z}^a_{nn'}$, are chosen such that the
potential of $n^a_{nn'} - \s{n}^a_{nn'} - \s{Z}^a_{nn'}$ is zero
outside their respective augmentation spheres. This is achieved by
doing a multipole expansion and requiring the expansion coefficients
to be zero, and entails a compensation of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pair compensation}
  \s{Z}^a_{nn'}(\br) = \sum_L Q^a_{L,nn'} \s{g}^a_L(\br)
\end{equation}
with the expansion coefficients
\begin{equation}
  Q^a_{L,nn'} = \sum_{i_1i_2} \Delta^a_{L,i_1i_2} P^{a*}_{ni_1} P^{a}_{n'i_2}
\end{equation}
The tensors $\Delta^a_{L,i_1i_2}$ are identical to those in \eqref{eq:
  Delta_Lij}.
\par Inserting the pair compensation charges \eqref{eq:pair
  compensation} in \eqref{eq:pair density with Z} and using this in
\eqref{eq:coulomb integrals} gives, after some manipulations,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coulomb integrals PAW}
  V_{n_1n_2n_3n_4} = (n_{n_3n_1}|n_{n_2n_4}) = (\s{\rho}_{n_3n_1}|\s{\rho}_{n_2n_4}) + 2 \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} P^{a}_{n_3i_1} P^{a*}_{n_1i_2} \Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} P^{a*}_{n_2i_3} P^{a}_{n_4i_4}
\end{equation}
where the tensor $\Delta C^a_{i_1i_2i_3i_4}$ is the same as the one
used in the atomic correction of the coulomb energy, \eqref{eq:coulom
  tensor 2}.

\subsubsection{Exact Exchange}
Append all the stuff on exact exchange?

\subsection{Wannier Orbitals}

The partly occupied maximally localized Wannier functions implemented
in ase/gpaw are constructed by doing a unitary rotation for the lowest
states (the \emph{fixed space}), and use a dynamically optimized
linear combination of the remaining orbitals (the \emph{active
  space}). Both linear combinations are chosen such as to minimize the
spread of the resulting wannierfunctions. The unitarity of the rotaion
in the fixed spaces, implies that the eigenvalues of the Bloch states
contained in the fixed space can all be exactly reproduced by the
resulting WF, whereas the largest eigenvalues of the WF will not
necessarily correspond to any ``real''
eigenvalues.\cite{Thygesen2005}

When constructing Wannier functions, the only quantities that needs to
be supplied by the DFT calculator are the integrals
$Z_{n_1n_2}^{\mathbf{G}} = \bra{\psi_{n_1}} e^{-\mathbf{G}\cdot \br}
\ket{\psi_{n_2}}$, where $\mathbf{G}$ is one of at most 6 possible (3
in an orthorhombic cell) vectors connecting nearest neighbor cells in
the reciprocal lattice. When introducing the PAW transformation, this
quantity can be expressed as\cite{Thygesen2005,Ferretti2007}
%
\begin{equation*}
  Z_{n_1n_2}^{\mathbf{G}} = \bra{\s{\psi}_{n_1}} e^{-\mathbf{G}\cdot \br} \ket{\s{\psi}_{n_2}} + \sum_a \sum_{i_1i_2} P^{a*}_{n_1i_1} P^{a}_{n_2i_2} \left( \bra{\phi^a_{i_1}}e^{-\mathbf{G}\cdot \br}\ket{\phi^a_{i_2}} - \bra{\s{\phi}^a_{i_1}}e^{-\mathbf{G}\cdot \br}\ket{\s{\phi}^a_{i_2}} \right).
\end{equation*}
%
Even for small systems, the phase of the exponential of the last
integral does not vary significantly over the region of space, where
$\s{p}^a_i$ is non-zero. The integral in the last term can therefore
safely be approximated by
%
\begin{equation*}
  e^{-\mathbf{G}\cdot \bR^a} \sum_{i_1i_2} P^{a*}_{n_1i_1} P^{a}_{n_2i_2} \sqrt{4\pi}\Delta^a_{00,i_1i_2}.
\end{equation*}
