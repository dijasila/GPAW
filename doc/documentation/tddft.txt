AB Exciton dynamics at an interface between an electron donor, rubrene, and
   a C-60 acceptor is studied by nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics
   simulation. Simulation results reveal an essential role of the phenyl
   groups in rubrene in increasing the charge-transfer rate by an
   order-of-magnitude. The atomistic mechanism of the enhanced charge
   transfer is found to be the amplification of aromatic breathing modes by
   the phenyl groups, which causes large fluctuations of electronic
   excitation energies. These findings provide insight into molecular
   structure design for efficient solar cells, while explaining recent
   experimental observations. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   interesting intermediate state of matter between molecular metal-ligand
   complexes and bulk metal. Such "metalloid" clusters are characterized by
   the balance between metal-metal bonds in the core and metal-ligand bonds
   at the exterior of the cluster. In previous studies, the electronic
   stability for the Al50Cp*(12) cluster was not fully understood. We show

AB Optical absorption of a gold nanocluster of 102 Au atoms protected by 44
   para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) ligands is measured in the range of
   0.05-6.2 eV (mid-IR to UV) by a combination of several techniques for
   purified samples in solid and solution phases. The results are compared
   to calculations for a model cluster Au-102(SMe)(44) based on the
   time-dependent density functional theory in the linear-response regime
   and using the known structure of Au-102(p-MBA)(44). The measured and
   calculated molar absorption coefficients in the NIR-vis region are
   comparable, within a factor of 2, in the absolute scale. Several
   characteristic features are observed in the absorption in the range of
   1.5-3.5 eV. The onset of the electronic transitions in the mid-IR region
   is experimentally observed at 0.45 +/- 0.05 eV which compares well with
   the lowest calculated transition at 0.55 eV. Vibrations in the ligand
   layer give rise to fingerprint IR features below the onset of low-energy
   metal-to-metal electronic transitions. Partial exchange of the p-MBA
   ligand to glutathione does not affect the onset of the electronic
   transitions, which indicates that the metal core of the cluster is not
   affected by the ligand exchange. The full spectroscopic characterization
   of the Au-102(p-MBA)(44) reported here for the first time gives
   benchmarks for further studies of manipulation and functionalization of
   this nanocluster to various applications.

AB Many thiolate-protected gold clusters prepared by wet-chemistry show
   abundances of certain compositions which can be explained by the
   shell-closing of the superatom orbitals 1S, 1P, 1D, ... , leading to
   magic-number series 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 58, etc. One recently isolated
   such cluster, Au-44(SPh)(28)(2-), is a potential candidate for the magic
   number 18, although its structure has not been determined. Applying the
   "divide-and-protect" concept and recent knowledge obtained from the
   structures of Au-25(SR)(18)(-) and Au-102(SR)(44) (-SR being a thiolate
   group), we compare two structural models for the Au-44(SR)(28)(2-)
   cluster. We have optimized their structures, computed powder X-ray
   diffraction patterns and optical absorption spectra, and performed the
   superatom analysis on them. The model featuring the -RS-Au-SR- and
   -RS-Au-SR-Au-SR- motifs in the protective layer shows better energetic
   stability and agreement with the experimental XRD pattern than the other
   model which has a protective layer including longer, polymeric
   RS(AuSR)(x) motifs. However, the computed optical spectra for both
   models are quite different from the experimental one. Our models here
   can serve as benchmarks for further proposals of Au-44(SR)(28)(2-)
   cluster structures.

AB A particularly stable thiolate-protected gold nanocluster,
   Au-25(SR)(18), was structurally characterized from X-ray crystallography
   in 2008, and concomitantly its electronic and optical properties were
   analyzed via density functional theory. The robust geometry and a
   well-understood electronic structure of this cluster motivate
   explorations of properties of extended systems made out of Au-25(SR)(18)
   building blocks. As a first step in this direction, we analyze here
   structural, vibrational, electronic, and optical properties of the Au-25
   cluster anion as it was observed in the crystalline environment and
   predict properties of cluster dimers, where the Au-25 units are linked
   together. via an aromatic dithiolate linker. We show that properties of
   each Au-25 unit of the dimer can be quite independently modified from
   the other by doping with a nonmagnetic (Pd) or magnetic (Mn) metal atom.
   We anticipate that material systems with interesting properties could be
   made from these building blocks, provided that a suitable chemistry for
   their controlled linking can be found.

AB Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in
   many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the
   Kohn-Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies
   the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with
   several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector
   augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package
   (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid
   representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more
   traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space
   grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational
   scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique
   feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in
   addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to
   the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between
   the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one
   to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional
   theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have
   implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the
   linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport
   calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW
   using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In
   addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also
   describe the implementation of selected exchange-correlation
   functionals, parallelization schemes, Delta SCF-method, x-ray absorption
   spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.

AB We calculate single-particle excitation energies for a series of 34
   molecules using fully self-consistent GW, one-shot G(0)W(0),
   Hartree-Fock (HF), and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). All
   calculations are performed within the projector-augmented wave method
   using a basis set of Wannier functions augmented by numerical atomic
   orbitals. The GW self-energy is calculated on the real frequency axis
   including its full frequency dependence and off-diagonal matrix
   elements. The mean absolute error of the ionization potential (IP) with
   respect to experiment is found to be 4.4, 2.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.5 eV for
   DFT-PBE, DFT-PBE0, HF, G(0)W(0) (HF), and self-consistent GW,
   respectively. This shows that although electronic screening is weak in
   molecular systems, its inclusion at the GW level reduces the error in
   the IP by up to 50% relative to unscreened HF. In general GW overscreens
   the HF energies leading to underestimation of the IPs. The best IPs are
   obtained from one-shot G(0)W(0) calculations based on HF since this
   reduces the overscreening. Finally, we find that the inclusion of
   core-valence exchange is important and can affect the excitation
   energies by as much as 1 eV.

AB Structure, electronic properties, optical absorption and charging
   properties of methylthiolate-protected bimetal PdAu24(SR)(18)(z) (R =
   Me) clusters with various charge states (-3 <= z <= + 3) are
   investigated by using density functional theory. The results are
   compared to properties of the well-understood singly anionic pure gold
   complex Au-25(SR)(18)((-1)) [J. Akola, M. Walter, H. Hakkinen and H.
   Gronbeck, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130, 3756]. The atomic structure of
   this all-gold complex can be written in a "divide-and-protect'' way [ H.
   Hakkinen, M. Walter and H. Gronbeck, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 9927]
   as Au-13[Au-2(SR)(3)](6)((-1)) where 6 v-shaped Au-2(SR)(3) ligands
   protect the close-to-icosahedral Au-13 core and where eight delocalized
   metal electrons, derived from Au(6s) electrons, comprise a stable
   closed-shell 1S(2)1P(6) "superatom'' configuration in the core. We show
   that the di-anion PdAu24(SR)(18)((-2)) is a corresponding eight-electron
   closed-shell species whereas the clusters PdAu24(SR)(18)(z), -1 <= z <=
   + 3, have holes in the 1P HOMO manifold. This indicates that the doping
   Pd atom remains close to the zero-valent 4d(10)5s(0) configuration and
   does not contribute electrons to the delocalized electron density in the
   gold core. Structural optimization shows that the all-gold
   "divide-and-protect'' structure motif is robust with respect to
   replacing the Au by Pd at the center of the core, at the surface of the
   core or in one of the protecting Au-2(SR)(3) ligands. However, optical
   absorption and the HOMO-LUMO and electrochemical gaps depend sensitively
   on the site of the doping Pd atom, which may turn out be useful for
   assigning the structure of PdAu24(SR)(18) from experimental data.
