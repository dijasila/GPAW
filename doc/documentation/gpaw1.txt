   databases of binding energies obtained experimentally or through
   high-quality calculations. We show that databases with up to a few
   hundred entries allow for up to of the order ten parameters to be
   adjusted in the exchange enhancement factor. The transferability of
   models between data is analyzed, and it is shown to be difficult to
   transfer a model trained exclusively on molecular atomization energies

AB Magnetic properties of a large assembly of ultrathin graphitic particles
   obtained by heavy sonication of graphite powder dispersed in
   N-methylpyrrolidone were measured by electron-spin resonance (ESR). The
   ESR signal was decomposed into one narrow and one broad component. The
   narrow component was associated with localized Curie-type defects. The
   temperature dependence of the predominant broad component points to a
   transition to a superparamagnetic-like state at 25 K. By performing the
   density-functional-theory calculations for graphene with selected
   extended defects (the sheet edges, zigzag chains of chemisorbed H atoms,
   and pentagon-octagon rows), we found considerable magnetic moments at C
   atoms in their vicinities. We attribute the magnetism in the graphitic
   particles to the localized electronic states near the defects in the
   network of the p electrons of graphene. The ferromagnetic (FM)
   correlations among magnetic moments at carbon atoms near the edges are
   not able to give rise to a long-range FM order.

AB Combining temperature-programmed reaction measurements, isotopic
   labeling experiments, and first-principles spin density functional
   theory, the dependence of the reaction temperature of catalyzed carbon
   monoxide oxidation on the oxidation state of Pd-13 clusters deposited on
   MgO surfaces grown on Mo(100) is explored. It is shown that molecular
   oxygen dissociates easily on the supported Pd-13 cluster, leading to
   facile partial oxidation to form Pd13O4 clusters with C-4 nu symmetry.
   Increasing the oxidation temperature to 370 K results in nonsymmetric
   Pd13O6 clusters. The higher symmetry, partially oxidized cluster is
   characterized by a relatively high activation energy for catalyzed
   combustion of the first CO molecule via a reaction of an adsorbed CO
   molecule with one of the oxygen atoms of the Pd13O4 cluster. Subsequent
   reactions on the resulting lower-symmetry Pd13Ox (x < 4) clusters entail
   lower activation energies. The nonsymmetric Pd13O6 clusters show lower
   temperature-catalyzed CO combustion, already starting at cryogenic

AB Building on results for the adsorption of benzene on Pt(111), the
   adsorption of benzaldehyde is investigated using density functional
   theory. Benzaldehyde is found to chemisorb preferentially with its
   aromatic ring in the flat-lying bridge geometry that is also preferred
   for benzene. Across the investigated geometries, adsorption is
   homogeneously weakened compared to corresponding benzene geometries.
   This is found to be true for very different adsorption modes, namely,
   eta(6) and eta(8) modes, the latter having metal atoms inserted in the
   carbonyl bond. Reorientation and diffusion of benzaldehyde is found to
   have low energy barriers. Aggregation of molecules in dimers bound by
   aryl C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds is
   investigated, and specific configurations are found to be up to 0.15 eV
   more favorable than optimally configured, separated adsorbates. The
   binding is significantly stronger than what is found for gas phase
   dimers, suggesting an enhancing effect of the metal interaction. (C)

AB The kinetics of acetylene adsorption and cyclotrimerization was studied
   by vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) and density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations. At low temperature, SFG shows two
   resonances corresponding to acetylene adsorbed in two different sites.
   Upon heating, two new vibrational resonances appear. We interpret these
   resonances as being due to C2H2 island formation and adsorbed C4H4,
   which is the intermediate in the subsequent cyclotrimerization reaction
   to form benzene. A kinetic model is applied, which allows determination
   of the relevant activation barriers. The barrier for C2H2 diffusion is
   determined to be 43 +/- 1 kJ/mol. The activation barrier for formation
   of the C4H4 intermediate is found to be 84 +/- 6 kJ/mol and the barrier
   for benzene formation 5 +/- 3 kJ/mol lower. Barriers to diffusion and
   formation of C4H4 and C6H6 obtained from DFT calculations are in
   quantitative agreement with the experiments once the locally high
   coverage in C2H2 islands is included.

   the meta-GGA functional predicts the experimentally observed attractive
   intermolecular interactions within the SAMs. In particular, the use of
   M06-L yields an increased stability of the SAMs with increasing alkyl
   chain length and an increased attractive interaction between RS-Au-SR

   MoS2 for temperatures T > 100 K. The materials properties including the
   electron-phonon interaction are calculated from first principles and the
   deformation potentials and Frohlich interaction in single-layer MoS2 are
   established. The calculated room-temperature mobility of similar to 410
   cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) is found to be dominated by optical phonon scattering
   via intra and intervalley deformation potential couplings and the
   Frohlich interaction. The mobility is weakly dependent on the carrier
   density and follows a mu similar to T-gamma temperature dependence with
   gamma = 1.69 at room temperature. It is shown that a quenching of the
   characteristic homopolar mode, which is likely to occur in top-gated
   samples, increases the mobility with similar to 70 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and
   can be observed as a decrease in the exponent to. = 1.52. In comparison
   to recent experimental findings for the mobility in single-layer MoS2
   (similar to 200 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)), our results indicate that mobilities
   close to the intrinsic phonon-limited mobility can be achieved in
   two-dimensional materials via dielectric engineering that effectively
   screens static Coulomb scattering on, e.g., charged impurities.

   surface-sensitive techniques, providing important information on the

   adsorbed on noble-metal (111) surfaces have been investigated by using

   transfer mainly from or into the ligand monolayer. The electronic
   properties of the 13-atom metal core remain in all cases rather

   interaction. We compare adsorption onto two model surfaces of SnO2,
   oxygen rich (stoichiometric) and oxygen poor (reduced), considered as
   limiting cases of varying oxygen abundance. With the chosen van der
   Waals approach [M. Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schroder, D. C. Langreth, and B.
   I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] it is found that on
   the stoichiometric surface, where binding has both a covalent nature and
   an ionic nature, with the addition of the van der Waals interaction the
   adsorption energy becomes somewhat stronger. However, on the reduced
   surface, where binding was earlier predicted to be more
   physisorptionlike by using a standard generalized gradient approximation
   (GGA) approach, the van der Waals interaction increases the adsorption
   energy by a larger factor. Furthermore, three different local-density
   approximation and GGA functionals are compared, as corrected with the
   van der Waals scheme. It is found that the correction brings those three
   to reasonably similar descriptions of adsorption on both surfaces.

   for molecular dynamics simulations of interfaces between natively
   deprotonated amorphous SiO2 surfaces and liquid water, to be used in
   combination with standard biomolecular force fields. We pay particular
   attention to the extent of negative charge delocalisation in the solid
   that follows the deprotonation of terminal silanol groups, as revealed
   by extensive Bader analysis of electronic densities computed by density
   functional theory (DFT). The absolute charge values in our force field
   are determined from best-fitting to the electrostatic potential computed
   ab initio (ESP charges). Our proposed parameter set is found to
   reproduce the energy landscape of single water molecules over neutral
   and deprotonated amorphous SiO2 surfaces and, after a minor adjustment,
   over thin oxide films on Si. Our analysis reveals a certain degree of
   arbitrariness in the choice of the DFT scheme used as the reference for
   the force-field optimisation procedure, highlighting its intrinsic
   limits.

AB One of the possible solutions to the world's rapidly increasing energy
   demand is the development of new photoelectrochemical cells with
   improved light absorption. This requires development of semiconductor
   materials which have appropriate bandgaps to absorb a large part of the
   solar spectrum at the same time as being stable in aqueous environments.
   Here we demonstrate an efficient, computational screening of relevant
   oxide and oxynitride materials based on electronic structure
   calculations resulting in the reduction of a vast space of 5400
   different materials to only 15 promising candidates. The screening is
   based on an efficient and reliable way of calculating semiconductor band
   gaps. The outcome of the screening includes all already known successful
   materials of the types investigated plus some new ones which warrant

AB We investigate the interaction between water molecules and gold
   nanoclusters Au(n) through a systematic density functional theory study
   within both the generalized gradient approximation and the nonlocal van
   der Waals (vdW) density functional theory. Both planar (n = 6-12) and
   three-dimensional (3D) clusters (n = 17-20) are studied. We find that
   applying vdW density functional theory leads to an increase in the Au-Au
   bond length and a decrease in the cohesive energy for all clusters
   studied. We classify water adsorption on nanoclusters according to the
   corner, edge, and surface adsorption geometries. In both corner and edge
   adsorptions, water molecule approaches the cluster through the O atom.
   For planar clusters, surface adsorption occurs in a O-up/H-down geometry
   with water plane oriented nearly perpendicular to the cluster. For 3D
   clusters, water instead favors a near-flat surface adsorption geometry
   with the water O atom sitting nearly atop a surface Au atom, in
   agreement with previous study on bulk surfaces. Including vdW
   interaction increases the adsorption energy for the weak surface
   adsorption but reduces the adsorption energy for the strong corner
   adsorption due to increased water-cluster bond length. By analyzing the
   adsorption induced charge rearrangement through Bader's charge
   partitioning and electron density difference and the orbital interaction
   through the projected density of states, we conclude that the bonding
   between water and gold nanocluster is determined by an interplay between
   electrostatic interaction and covalent interaction involving both the
   water lone-pair and in-plane orbitals and the gold 5d and 6s orbitals.
   Including vdW interaction does not change qualitatively the physical
   picture but does change quantitatively the adsorption structure due to
   the fluxionality of gold nanoclusters. (C) 2012 American Institute of

   microscopy (STM) measurements. The experiments were carried out both on
   a clean surface and on a chirally modified surface, using chemisorbed
   (R)-(+)-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine, ((R)-NEA), as the modifier. On the
   nonmodified surface, introduction of H-2 at a background pressure of
   similar to 1 X 10(-6) mbar leads to the rapid break-up of TFAP dimer
   structures followed by the gradual removal of all TFAP-related images.
   During the latter step, some monomers display an extra protrusion
   compared to TFAP in dimer structures. They are attributed to a
   half-hydrogenated intermediate. The introduction of H-2 to a mixture of
   (R)-NEA and TFAP on Pt(111) leads to the removal of TFAP without any
   change in the population of the modifier, as required for an efficient

AB Linear sp-hybridized carbon chains have recently been proposed as
   one-dimensional nanostructures for electronic applications and as
   intermediate products in many nanoscale processes. However, their
   synthesis and observation are affected by their degradation upon oxygen
   exposure. Carbon chains consisting of alternating single and triple
   bonds (polyynic) are reported to be more stable than those consisting of
   double bonds (cumulenic), but the details of the degradation mechanism
   are still unknown. We use density functional theory to show that
   adsorption of O(2) on carbon chains anchored to carbon substrates can
   cause their cleavage through the collective scission of O-O and C-C
   bonds, yielding separate CO-terminated chains. Further O(2) attack
   progressively shortens them, causing CO(2) formation. While the
   shortening process has general validity, the cleavage step of the
   reaction is exothermic for cumulenic chains only. Perturbations of the
   ideal structure, such as bending of the chains or modifications to the
   structure of their termination, affect the oxidation mechanism and can
   make the cleavage reaction exothermic for polyynic chains as well. These
   results contribute to the interpretation of the available experimental
   results and reveal atomic-scale details of the oxidation process,. thus
   allowing predictions on the chemistry of nanostructured carbon surfaces
   and suggesting possible new directions for the study of the chemical
   stability of carbynoid structures.

   Ag 3d band, which is crucial to avoid overscreening the plasmon by the
   s-d interband transitions. For the clean surface, this approach
   reproduces the experimental plasmon energies and dispersion to within
   0.15 eV. Adsorption of hydrogen shifts and damps the Ag(111) surface
   plasmon and induces a new peak in the loss function at 0.6 eV below the

   between states located on the hydrogen atoms and states on the Ag

AB The structure of liquid water at ambient conditions is studied in ab
   initio molecular dynamics simulations in the NVE ensemble using van der
   Waals (vdW) density-functional theory, i.e., using the new
   exchange-correlation functionals optPBE-vdW and vdW-DF2, where the
   latter has softer nonlocal correlation terms. Inclusion of the more
   isotropic vdW interactions counteracts highly directional hydrogen
   bonds, which are enhanced by standard functionals. This brings about a
   softening of the microscopic structure of water, as seen from the
   broadening of angular distribution functions and, in particular, from
   the much lower and broader first peak in the oxygen-oxygen
   pair-correlation function (PCF) and loss of structure in the outer
   hydration shells. Inclusion of vdW interactions is shown to shift the
   balance of resulting structures from open tetrahedral to more
   close-packed. The resulting O-O PCF shows some resemblance with
   experiment for high-density water (Soper, A. K.; Ricci, M.A. Phys. Rev.
   Lett. 2000, 84, 2881), but not directly with experiment for ambient
   water. Considering the accuracy of the new functionals for interaction
   energies, we investigate whether the simulation protocol could cause the
   deviation. An O-O PCF consisting of a linear combination of 70% from
   vdW-DF2 and 30% from low-density liquid water, as extrapolated from
   experiments, reproduces near-quantitatively the experimental O-O PCF for
   ambient water. This suggests the possibility that the new functionals
   maybe reliable and that instead larger-scale simulations in the NPT
   ensemble, where the density is allowed to fluctuate in accordance with
   proposals for supercooled water, could resolve the apparent discrepancy
   with the measured PCF.

AB Non-aqueous Li-air or Li-O-2 cells show considerable promise as a very
   high energy density battery couple. Such cells, however, show sudden
   death at capacities far below their theoretical capacity and this, among
   other problems, limits their practicality. In this paper, we show that
   this sudden death arises from limited charge transport through the
   growing Li2O2 film to the Li2O2-electrolyte interface, and this
   limitation defines a critical film thickness, above which it is not
   possible to support electrochemistry at the Li2O2-electrolyte interface.
   We report both electrochemical experiments using a reversible internal
   redox couple and a first principles metal-insulator-metal charge
   transport model to probe the electrical conductivity through Li2O2 films
   produced during Li-O-2 discharge. Both experiment and theory show a
   "sudden death" in charge transport when film thickness is similar to 5
   to 10 nm. The theoretical model shows that this occurs when the
   tunneling current through the film can no longer support the
   electrochemical current. Thus, engineering charge transport through
   Li2O2 is a serious challenge if Li-O-2 batteries are ever to reach their
   potential. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB The atomic-scale processes taking place during the sliding of diamond
   and diamond-like carbon surfaces are investigated using classical
   molecular dynamics simulations. During the initial sliding stage,
   diamond surfaces undergo an amorphization process, while an sp(3) to
   sp(2) conversion takes place in tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) and
   amorphous hydrocarbon (a-C:H) surface layers. Upon separation of the
   sliding samples, the interface fails. A rather smooth failure occurs for
   a-C:H, where the hydrogen atoms present in the bulk passivate the
   chemically active carbon dangling bonds. Conversely, sp-hybridized
   carbon chains are observed to form on diamond and ta-C surfaces. These
   carbynoid structures are known to undergo a fast degradation process
   when in contact with oxygen. Using quantum-accurate density functional
   theory simulations, we present a possible mechanism for the
   oxygen-induced degradation of the carbon chains, leading to oxidative
   wear of the sp phase on diamond and ta-C surfaces upon exposure to air.
   Oxygen molecules chemisorb on C-C bonds of the chains, triggering the
   cleavage of the chains through concerted O-O and C-C bond-breaking
   reactions. A similar reaction caused by adsorption of water molecules on
   the carbon chains is ruled out on energetic grounds. Further O-2
   adsorption causes the progressive shortening of the resulting,
   O-terminated, chain fragments through the same O-O and C-C bond breaking
   mechanism accompanied by the formation of CO2 molecules.

   are detected for the terpy end-group, including flat physisorption,
   distorted chemisorption through N-Cu bonds, and H-dissociative
   chemisorption through N-Cu and C-Cu bonds. These illustrate and explore
   various bonding modes of molecules at surfaces, which also imply a
   greater richness of reaction pathways, both of which are of central
   importance in a wide variety of heterogeneous catalytic processes on
   metal catalysts. As deposited on the cold substrate (near 77 K), the
   molecules are preferably chemisorbed on the surface through N-Cu bonds.
   With increasing annealing temperature, the molecules are converted to a
   physisorption configuration at and above 300 K, and above 370 K a small
   fraction of molecules undergoes dehydrogenation and chemisorb on the

   (X-ray absorption (XAS), X-ray emission (XES). and X-ray photoemission
   (XPS)) in the real-space-grid-based Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) GPAW
   code. The implementation for XAS is based on the Haydock recursion
   method avoiding computation of unoccupied states. The absolute energy
   scale is computed with the Delta Kohn-Sham method which is possible
   using specific PAW setups for the core-hole states. We show computed
   spectra for selected test cases (gas phase H2O and bulk diamond) and
   discuss the dependence on grid spacing and box size. In the case of
   diamond we include vibrational effects by sampling spectra from the
   ground state vibrational distribution and discuss the importance of
   those effects for the experimentally observed features. We apply the
   method to XPS, XES and XAS of CO adsorbed on Ni(1 0 0) and compare to
   experimental data where possible. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights

AB The van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) family of
   exchange-correlation functionals is a promising step towards accounting
   for van der Waals interactions in density functional theory. This
   approach consists of a nonlocal correlation term in addition to
   semilocal generalized gradient approximation exchange and local density
   approximation correlation. It has proven useful for describing vdW
   bonded complexes but unfortunately deteriorates the prediction of
   solid-state properties such as bulk lattice parameters and cohesive
   energies, as compared to the underlying GGA functional. By considering a
   broad range of different condensed matter systems including weakly
   interacting complexes as well as strongly bonded molecules and bulk
   solids, we show that inclusion of gradient-corrected correlations in
   vdW-DF-type calculations may not only improve the accuracy for vdW
   bonded systems, but also amend vdW-DF deficiencies in predicting
   structural properties of solids. Based on this insight we construct a
   prototype vdW-DF which demonstrates high accuracy in describing the
   dispersive interactions responsible for benzene adsorption on the noble
   Au(111) surface.

   geometry of the BPA-PC segments that consist of two to three adjacent
   groups of the polymer. Our DFT results show that the adsorption is
   dominated by the vdW interaction. It is also important to include the
   interaction of nearest-neighbor groups in order to provide a realistic

AB Asymmetric line shapes can occur in the transmission function describing
   electron transport in the vicinity of a minimum caused by quantum
   interference effects. Such asymmetry can be used to increase the
   thermoelectric efficiency of molecular junctions. So far, however,
   asymmetric line shapes have been only empirically found for just a few
   rather complex organic molecules where the origins of the line shapes
   relation to molecular structure were not resolved. In the present, work
   we introduce a method to analyze the structure dependence of the
   asymmetry of interference dips from simple two site tight-binding
   models, where one site corresponds to a molecular pi orbital of the wire
   and the other to an atomic p(z) orbital of a side group, which allows us
   to characterize analytically the peak shape in terms of just two
   parameters. We assess our scheme with first-principles electron
   transport calculations for a variety of t-stub molecules and also
   address their suitability for thermoelectric applications. (C) 2011

AB Dissociation of the first C-H bond of methane was investigated at the
   interface of partial PdO(101) monolayer and supporting Pd(100) surface
   with density functional calculations. Activation pathways of CH(4) on
   the bulk PdO(100), PdO(101), Pd(100), and Pd(100) supported PdO(101)
   monolayer surfaces were also examined. The PdO(101)@:Pd(100) boundary
   enables several new routes for methane dissociation compared to the bulk
   surfaces, the lowest activation energy barrier being 0.8 eV. The barrier
   on the most stable and dominant bulk PdO(100) surface is as high as 1.2
   eV, whereas on the lower proportion bulk PdO(101) surface it is only 0.5
   eV. However, the corresponding barrier increases to 1.2 eV in the case
   of supported PdO(101) monolayer. A low activation energy of 0.7 eV is
   observed also on the Pd(100) surface, however, the reaction enthalpy on
   the metal surface is not as favored as on oxide surfaces or at the phase
   boundary. Hydrogen diffusion from metal to oxide phase can improve the
   reaction enthalpy, but it causes increase in the total activation
   energy. Overall, the results indicate that the presence of phase
   boundary between PdO and Pd enhances the activity in methane combustion,
   rationalizing experimental findings.

   physics, and molecular biology. Very recently, synthesis and electronic
   properties of "nanoalloy" clusters Au144-xAgx(SR)(60) were reported.
   Here density functional theory is used for electronic structure and
   bonding in Au144-xAgx(SR)(60) based on a structural model of the
   icosahedral Au-144(SR)(60) that features a 114-atom metal core with 60
   symmetry-equivalent surface sites and a protecting layer of 30 RSAuSR
   units. In the optimal configuration the 60 surface sites of the core are
   occupied by silver in Au84Ag60(SR)(60). Silver enhances the electron
   shell structure around the Fermi level in the metal core, which predicts
   a structured absorption spectrum around the onset (similar to 0.8 eV) of
   electronic metal-to-metal transitions. The calculations also imply
   element-dependent absorption edges for Au(5d) -> Au(6sp) and Ag(4d) ->
   Ag(5sp) interband transitions in the "plasmonic" region, with their
   relative intensities controlled by the Ag/Au mixing ratio.

AB Surface state localization and hybridization on B, Mg, and Li terminated
   MgB2(0001) surfaces are studied within density functional theory (DFT).
   For the B terminated surface we find a low energy B sigma(1) surface
   state, a sp(z) surface state, and B sigma(2) and sigma(3) quantum well
   states, which are 90% localized in the topmost B layer. Our results
   demonstrate that by charging the B atomic layer, either by changing the
   surface termination or through electro-chemical doping, the B sigma
   surface states are shifted down in energy, filled, and delocalize
   through hybridization as they cross the bulk MgB2 bulk bands. On the
   other hand, the spz surface state should be shifted up in energy,
   emptied, and gain an increasingly metallic s character by adding a Mg,
   Mg+1, or Li terminating atomic layer. These results clearly show both
   the robust nature of MgB2(0001) surface states, and how their
   localization and energy range may be tuned by surface termination and
   charging, with implications for the superconducting and plasmonic
   behavior of MgB2.

AB Effects of atomic layer deposited (ALD) aluminum oxide barriers on
   electron injection, recombination reactions, and efficiency of
   dye-sensitized solar cells were studied. The amorphous AlO(x)
   submonolayers prepared on nanocrystalline 2 mu m thick TiO(2) anatase
   film were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy. Time-of-flight elastic recoil detection method was employed
   to study the growth of similar AlO(x) layers on planar anatase films.
   Density functional theory calculations of the first ALD cycle over a
   (101) anatase surface revealed atomic scale roughness of the deposited
   layer owing to unequal adsorption sites and lateral repulsions between
   adsorbed precursor molecules. Calculations also indicate that the holes
   in the first AlO(x) layer allow triiodide but not the ruthenium
   bipyridyl sensitizer to reach the TiO(2) surface. After the first
   deposition cycle the dye binds to AlO(x) and is in average about 0.2 nm
   farther from the TiO(2) surface than when binding to the bare TiO(2)
   surface. Increase in average distance between the dye and TiO(2) surface
   was considered as the main reason for reduced electron injection
   efficiency observed for all coated sensitized films. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy indicated that also recombination reactions of
   the conduction band electrons with the electrolyte triiodide molecules
   were reduced. The exponential increase in charge transfer resistance at
   the dye-TiO(2)-electrolyte interface as a function of the number of ALD
   cycles indicated that AlO(x) barrier layers affect recombination mainly
   through the tunnel barrier mechanism. Decrease of both the short circuit
   current and efficiency of the solar cells prepared from above-mentioned
   films as the number of ALD cycles was increased suggests that the
   suppression of the recombination could not compensate for the
   barrier-induced losses of electron injection.

AB We propose a method for constructing small atomic basis sets that
   optimally mimic the Kohn-Sham wave functions of an underlying plane-wave
   calculation. The key quantity of the optimization procedure is the
   spillage: the relative amount of the occupied Hilbert-space norm lost in
   the projection onto the atomic basis. To ensure full flexibility in the
   radial shape, we represent the basis functions by radial momentum-space
   spline functions. With our approach we reach spillages in the order of
   10(-4) when using minimal basis sets. Band structure calculations on top
   of a self-consistent linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO) run
   reproduce the occupied part of the band structure within a few tens meV.
   However, minimal basis sets are not flexible enough for obtaining
   material properties such as the lattice constant and the bulk modulus
   but require basis sets with f orbitals. Basis sets generated for Si,
   GaN, Al, and NaCl reach a spillage of similar to 10(-5) and reproduce
   lattice constants and bulk moduli within 0.03% and 5%, respectively.

AB Soft-landed adsorption of Au-16 on bilayered graphene is investigated
   using density functional theory. The orientation of the Au-16 cluster
   and number of neighboring surface vacancies affect the overall
   structural and electronic properties of the cluster. The results of the
   PBE, vdW-DF, and vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functionals are compared
   for the cluster-substrate interaction for systems with and without
   defects. In the presence of defects size two and greater, an Au atom
   adsorbs into the topmost graphene layer; this strongly influences the
   binding energy (>3 eV), while inducing substantial bending in the carbon
   plane and altering electronic properties of the system. Though the
   T-d-symmetry and electronegative properties of the Au-16 structure
   change in the presence of greater neighboring defects, elements of the
   cagelike starting structure remain throughout. The electron localization
   function shows that the in-plane Au-C bonds are of delocalized
   (metallic) nature and there is a local charge transfer to the
   coordinating Au. However, the net charge transfer between adsorbate and
   substrate is considerable only for the defect-free case (0.8e to Au-16).
   Finally, the binding of O-2 molecules to the adsorbed Au-16 cluster is
   used to probe the potential catalytic activity of graphite and carbon
   nanotube systems, and in one case (for defect size two) the adsorbed O-2
   switches on the catalytically active superoxo-state.

AB Os(II)/(III) and Co(II)/(III) polypyridine complexes in aqueous solution
   are robust molecular entities both in freely solute state and adsorbed
   on Au(111)- and Pt(111)-electrode surfaces. This class of robust
   coordination chemical compounds have recently been characterized by
   electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (in situ STM). The
   Os-complexes were found to display strong tunneling spectroscopic (STS)
   features at the level of resolution of the single molecule while STS
   features of the Co complexes, although clear, were much weaker. The data
   was framed by concise but phenomenological theory of interfacial
   electrochemical electron transfer extended to the electrochemical in
   situ STM configuration. With a view on first-principle insight into the
   in situ STM behavior of robust redox (as opposed to nonredox) molecules,
   we present in this report a density functional theory (DFT) study of the
   complexes in both free and adsorbate state, in either state exposed to
   both stoichiometric counterions and a large assembly of solvent water
   molecules. The oxidation states of the complexes were controlled, first
   by introducing chlorine counter atoms followed by spontaneous attraction
   of electrons from the complexes, also at first in electrostatically
   neutral form. Second, the solvent is found to provide strong dielectric
   screening of this charge transfer process and to be crucial for
   achieving the full chemically meaningful charge separated ionic
   oxidation states. The molecular charge and structure of the complexes in
   the presence of the solvent, are conserved upon adsorption, whereas the
   structural features of the different oxidation states are completely
   lost upon adsorption under vacuum conditions. Detailed microscopic
   insight such as offered by the present study will be important in
   molecular-based approaches to "smart" redox molecules enclosed in in
   situ STM or other nanoscale and single-molecules scale configurations in
   condensed matter environments.

AB Density functional theory developed by Hohenberg, Kohn and Sham is a
   widely accepted, reliable ab initio method. We present a non-periodic,
   real space, mesh-free convex approximation scheme for Kohn-Sham density
   functional theory. We rewrite the original variational problem as a
   saddle point problem and discretize it using basis functions which form
   the Pareto optimum between competing objectives of maximizing entropy
   and minimizing the total width of the approximation scheme. We show the
   utility of the approximation scheme in performing both all-electron and
   pseudopotential calculations, the results of which are in good agreement
   with literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Metal clusters stabilized by a surface ligand shell represent an
   interesting intermediate state of matter between molecular metal-ligand
   complexes and bulk metal. Such "metalloid" clusters are characterized by
   the balance between metal-metal bonds in the core and metal-ligand bonds
   at the exterior of the cluster. In previous studies, the electronic
   stability for the Al50Cp*(12) cluster was not fully understood. We show
   here that the known cluster Al50Cp*(12) can be considered as an analogue
   to a giant atom ("superatom") with 138 sp electrons organized in
   concentric angular momentum shells up to L = 6 symmetry.

AB Catalysis plays a critical role in chemical conversion, energy
   production and pollution mitigation. High activation barriers associated
   with rate-limiting elementary steps require most commercial
   heterogeneous catalytic reactions to be run at relatively high
   temperatures, which compromises energy efficiency and the long-term
   stability of the catalyst. Here we show that plasmonic nanostructures of
   silver can concurrently use low-intensity visible light (on the order of
   solar intensity) and thermal energy to drive catalytic oxidation
   reactions-such as ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH(3)
   oxidation-at lower temperatures than their conventional counterparts
   that use only thermal stimulus. Based on kinetic isotope experiments and
   density functional calculations, we postulate that excited plasmons on
   the silver surface act to populate O(2) antibonding orbitals and so form
   a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the
   rate-limiting O(2)-dissociation reaction. The results could assist the
   design of catalytic processes that are more energy efficient and robust
   than current processes.

   tight-binding models is used to derive an orthogonal d-band

   The energetics of test structures that were not included in the fit are

AB Using density functional theory we have studied the adsorption
   properties of different atoms and molecules deposited on a
   stoichiometric, reduced, and oxidized rutile TiO2(110) surface.
   Depending on the oxidation state of the surface, electrons can flow from
   or to the substrate and, therefore, negatively or positively charged
   species are expected. In particular, we have found that a charge
   transfer process from or to the surface always occurs for highly
   electronegative or highly electropositive species, respectively. For
   atoms or molecules with intermediate electron affinity, the direction of
   the charge flow depends on the oxidation state of the rutile surface and
   on the adsorption site. Generally, the charging effect leads to more
   stable complexes. However, the increase in the binding energy of the
   adsorbates is highly dependent on the electronic states of the surface
   prior to the adsorption event. In this work we have analyzed in details
   these mechanisms and we have also established a direct correlation
   between the enhanced binding energy of the adsorbates and the induced
   gap states. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB Low electronic conduction is expected to be a main limiting factor in
   the performance of reversible lithium-air, Li-O(2), batteries. Here, we
   apply density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function
   calculations to determine the electronic transport through lithium
   peroxide, Li(2)O(2), formed at the cathode during battery discharge. We
   find the transport to depend on the orientation and lattice matching of
   the insulator-metal interface in the presence of Au and Pt catalysts.
   Bulk lithium vacancies are found to be available and mobile under
   battery charging conditions, and found to pin the Fermi level at the top
   of the anti bonding peroxide pi*(2p(x)) and pi*(2p(y)) levels in the
   Li(2)O(2) valence band. Under an applied bias, this can result in a
   reduced transmission, since the anti bonding sigma*(2p(z)) level in the
   Li(2)O(2) conduction band is found to couple strongly to the metal
   substrate and create localized interface states with poor coupling to
   the Li(2)O(2) bulk states. These observations provide a possible
   explanation for the higher overpotential observed for charging than
   discharge. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide on an OH-terminated
   TiO2(101) anatase surface was studied employing density functional
   theory calculations. The formation of the Al2O3-TiO2 interface during
   the first atomic layer deposition cycle was modeled by studying the
   dissociative adsorption of an Al(CH3)(3) precursor, followed with a
   H2O-pulse reaction step that changes the surface termination.
   Calculations provide evidence for the formation of a discontinuous,
   atomically rough aluminum oxide layer after the first cycle. To explore
   the role of the aluminum oxide layer on adsorption of a ruthenium-based
   N3 dye molecule, various adsorption geometries were investigated.
   Calculations show that even one Al2O3 ALD cycle is enough to block N3
   adsorption on the TiO2. Consequently, N3 anchors to the aluminum oxide
   layer, which increases the dye-TiO2 distance by similar to 2 angstrom,
   changes the adsorption site, and weakens the coupling to TiO2. All these
   factors suppress forward electron injection from the dye molecule to the
   TiO2 conduction band edge. It is, therefore, questionable whether the
   aluminum oxide layer can offer improvements to the conversion efficiency
   in dye-sensitized solar cells.

AB Electronic and spectral properties of small TiO2 particles have been
   studied in order to gain more knowledge on their dependence on the
   crystal- and particle-size distributions. Our goal is to extend the
   recently developed light scattering based method for determining
   submicrometer size particles to nanoparticles. For that, we need to know
   how the refractive index function depends on the cluster size. As a
   first step, we have used time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) calculations having a focus on the shape changes of the
   calculated spectra, which can be related to changes in the refractive
   index function. Starting from the structure of TiO2 molecule for the two
   smallest particles and truncated bulk anatase structure for larger
   particles, the structures for (TiO2)(n) clusters, n = {1, 2, 8, 18, 28,
   38}, have been modeled. After the structure optimization using standard
   density functional theory (DFT) approach, the photoabsorption spectra
   for the optimized particle structures have been calculated by using
   TDDFT calculations. The results show slight evidence of the band gap
   broadening in the case of three out of the smallest particles and strong
   structural dependence of electronic and spectral properties, which can
   partly be related to the transformation of the electron structure, and
   breaking of the crystal symmetry as the size of the particle becomes
   smaller. These findings indicate that in the case of small particles
   their refractive index function can differ from the bulk values, and
   this has to be taken into account in the interpretation of
   light-scattering measurements.

   prevalent technique for providing fault tolerance in such high-end
   systems. Considerable research has focussed on optimizing checkpointing;

   for users. In this paper, we study the checkpointing overhead seen by
   various applications running on leadership-class machines like the IBM
   Blue Gene/P at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition to studying
   popular applications, we design a methodology to help users understand
   and intelligently choose an optimal checkpointing frequency to reduce
   the overall checkpointing overhead incurred. In particular, we study the

   Molecular Dynamics application, the Nek5000 computational fluid dynamics
   application and the Parallel Ocean Program application-and analyze their

AB We present a theoretical investigation of the hydrogenation of pyrene

   functional theory (DFT) at the GGA-PBE level, the chemical binding of
   atomic hydrogen to pyrene is found to be exothermic by up to 1.6 eV with
   a strong site dependence. The edge C atoms are found most reactive. The
   barrier for the formation of the hydrogen-pyrene bond is small, down to
   0.06 eV. A second hydrogen binds barrierless at many sites. The most
   stable structure of dihydrogenpyrene is more stable by 0.64 eV than
   pyrene plus a molecular hydrogen molecule and a large barrier of 3.7 eV
   for the molecular hydrogen evolution is found. Using a simple
   tight-binding model we demonstrate that the projected density of
   pi-states can be used to predict the most stable binding sites for
   hydrogen atoms and the model is used to investigate the most favorable
   binding sites on more hydrogenated pyrene molecules and on coronene.

AB A realistic treatment of metallic and semimetallic systems in polar
   environments requires an explicit treatment of charges induced into the
   metallic surface. In classical electrostatics, a metallic surface is
   properly described if the electric field perpendicular to the surface
   vanishes. For nanoscale materials, however, charge screening is
   imperfect because the nanoscale object's surface density of states is
   finite. Here, we demonstrate that from quantum considerations a
   classical mean-field charge-transfer model can be extracted, which is
   demonstrated for graphene and metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes. The
   model is easily parametrized and gives an approximate description of the
   binding of point charges on these structures. Potential applications
   include the modeling of charged or fully biased nanoscale systems in a
   polar environment, which we demonstrate by simulating a water droplet in
   a biased graphene nanocapacitor at a fraction of the computational cost
   of a fully quantum-mechanical treatment.

AB Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) is a promising spectroscopic tool
   for molecular junctions. The principles in TVS is to find the minimum on
   a Fowler-Nordheim plot where ln(I/V(2)) is plotted against 1/V and
   relate the voltage at the minimum V(min) to the closest molecular level.
   Importantly, V(min) is approximately half the voltage required to see a
   peak in the dI/dV curve. Information about the molecular level position
   can thus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show
   that the molecular level position can be determined at even lower
   voltages, V(min)((alpha)), by finding the minimum of ln(I/V(alpha)) with
   alpha < 2. On the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we
   analyze theoretical ab initio as well as experimental I -V curves and
   show that the voltage required to determine the molecular levels can be
   reduced by similar to 30% as compared to conventional TVS. As for
   conventional TVS, the symmetry/asymmetry of the molecular junction needs
   to be taken into account in order to gain quantitative information. We
   show that the degree of asymmetry may be estimated from a plot of
   V(min)((alpha)) vs alpha.

   characteristic features are observed in the absorption in the range of
   1.5-3.5 eV. The onset of the electronic transitions in the mid-IR region
   is experimentally observed at 0.45 +/- 0.05 eV which compares well with
   the lowest calculated transition at 0.55 eV. Vibrations in the ligand
   layer give rise to fingerprint IR features below the onset of low-energy
   metal-to-metal electronic transitions. Partial exchange of the p-MBA

AB Quantum interference (QI) in molecular transport junctions can lead to
   dramatic reductions of the electron transmission at certain energies. In
   a recent work [Markussen et al., Nano Lett., 2010, 10, 4260] we showed
   how the presence of such transmission nodes near the Fermi energy can be
   predicted solely from the structure of a conjugated molecule when the
   energies of the atomic p(z) orbitals do not vary too much. Here we relax
   the assumption of equal on-site energies and generalize the graphical
   scheme to molecules containing different atomic species. We use this
   diagrammatic scheme together with tight-binding and density functional
   theory calculations to investigate QI in linear molecular chains and
   aromatic molecules with different side groups. For the molecular chains
   we find a linear relation between the position of the transmission nodes
   and the side group p orbital energy. In contrast, the transmission
   functions of functionalized aromatic molecules generally display a
   rather complex nodal structure due to the interplay between molecular
   topology and the energy of the side group orbital.

   SrTiO3 perovskite is presented. We find a net attraction between two
   hydrogen atoms with an optimal separation of similar to 2.3 angstrom.
   The energy gain is ca. 0.33 eV compared to two non-interacting H
   defects. The main cause of the net attractive potential is elastic
   defect interactions through lattice deformation. Two possible diffusion
   paths for the hydrogen defect pair are investigated and are both
   determined to be faster than the corresponding diffusion path for single
   hydrogen atoms. Finally, we set up a simple model to determine the
   contribution from the double hydrogen defect to the total hydrogen flux,
   and find the double defect to be the main diffusing species at
   temperatures below ca. 400 degrees C. Post submission infrared
   absorption experiments show excellent agreement with the proposed
   properties of the double hydrogen defect.

AB Electronic structure calculations are a widely used tool in materials
   science and large consumer of supercomputing resources. Traditionally,
   the software packages for these kind of simulations have been
   implemented in compiled languages, where Fortran in its different
   versions has been the most popular choice. While dynamic, interpreted
   languages, such as Python, can increase the efficiency of programmer,
   they cannot compete directly with the raw performance of compiled
   languages. However, by using an interpreted language together with a
   compiled language, it is possible to have most of the productivity
   enhancing features together with a good numerical performance. We have
   used this approach in implementing an electronic structure simulation
   software GPAW using the combination of Python and C programming
   languages. While the chosen approach works well in standard workstations
   and Unix environments, massively parallel supercomputing systems can
   present some challenges in porting, debugging and profiling the
   software. In this paper we describe some details of the implementation
   and discuss the advantages and challenges of the combined Python/C
   approach. We show that despite the challenges it is possible to obtain
   good numerical performance and good parallel scalability with Python
   based software.

   core size of 1.4 nm (similar to "Schmid gold" or Nanogold(R)) from the
   viewpoint of the Superatom-Complex (SAC) model for ligand protected
   metal clusters, and in consideration of the ligand-adatom groups
   observed previously for the structurally known 39-atom cluster
   [Au(39)(PR(3))(14)Cl(6)](-1). Density functional theory is used to
   define the formation energy of various compositions and structures,
   enabling a comparison of the stability of different cluster-sizes. In
   agreement with the SAC model, we find a strong correlation between
   optimal energy and delocalized electron shell closings: The 58 electron
   shell closing is a driving force behind the energetics. Of all
   compositions studied here, the energetically best one is
   [Au(69)(PR(3))(20)Cl(12)](-1) anion, which has a truncated decahedral
   37-atom core encapsulated by 20 Au:PR(3) and 12 Au-Cl groups. It is
   energetically and chemically far superior to the standard models based
   on Au(55)(PR(3))(12)X(6). Critical comparisons are made to recent

AB O-2 dissociation on Pt(111) has been followed at low and saturation
   coverage using temperature-programmed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   and simulated with mean-field kinetic modeling, yielding dissociation
   (E-a) and desorption (E-d) barriers of 0.32 and 0.36 eV, respectively.
   Density functional theory calculations show that E-a is strongly
   influenced by the O-O interatomic potential in the atomic final state:
   of the supercells considered, that which maximizes attractive
   third-nearest-neighbor interactions in the atomic final state yields
   both the lowest computed dissociation barrier (0.24 eV) and the best
   agreement with experiment. It is proposed that the effect of
   adsorbate-adsorbate interactions must be considered when modeling
   catalytic processes involving dissociative steps. (C) 2010 American

   growth. Thus it is very important to understand the carbon chemistry on
   nanometer size metal particles. First-principles electronic-structure
   calculations have been used to investigate carbon monoxide (CO)
   disproportionation on an isolated Fe(55) cluster. After CO dissociation,
   O atoms remain on the surface while C atoms move into the cluster,
   presumably as the initial step towards carbide formation. The lowest CO
   dissociation barrier found on the cluster (0.63 eV) is lower than on
   most studied Fe surfaces. The dissociation occurs on a vertex between
   the facets. A possible path for CO(2) formation was also identified with
   a lowest reaction barrier of 1.04 eV.

AB The investigation of electron transport processes in nano-scale
   architectures plays a crucial role in the development of surface
   chemistry and nano-technology. Experimentally, an important driving
   force within this research area has been the concurrent refinements of
   scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques. The theoretical
   treatment of the STM operation has traditionally been based on the
   Bardeen and Tersoff-Hamann methods which take as input the
   single-particle wave functions and eigenvalues obtained from finite
   cluster or slabs models of the surface-tip interface. Here, we present a
   novel STM simulation scheme based on non-equilibrium Green's functions
   (NEGF) and Wannier functions which is both accurate and very efficient.
   The main novelty of the scheme compared to the Bardeen and
   Tersoff-Hamann approaches is that the coupling to the infinite
   (macroscopic) electrodes is taken into account. As an illustrating
   example we apply the NEGF-STM method to the Si(001)(2x1):H surface with
   sub-surface P doping and discuss the results in comparison to the
   Bardeen and Tersoff-Hamann methods.

   The latter is essential for treating the vdW interaction, which is
   crucial for the adsorption distances and energies of the rather weakly
   bound graphene. When additional iridium atoms are put on top of

AB Density functional theory calculations were used to investigate the
   stability of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to
   nanoparticles. The total energies and the adhesion energies between the
   CNTs and the nanoparticles were calculated for systems where the
   nanoparticles were either pure Ni or Ni carbide. It was found that the
   adhesion between the CNT and a pure Ni cluster is stronger than between
   the same CNT and a Ni carbide cluster although the energy difference was
   small compared to the total adhesion energies. This adhesion strength
   implies that CNTs are likely to remain attached to both pure Ni and Ni
   carbide clusters and that either pure Ni or Ni carbide clusters may be
   docked onto the open CNT ends to achieve continued growth or electronic
   contacts between CNTs and electrode materials. The system with a CNT
   attached to a pure Ni cluster was found to be energetically favored
   compared to a system containing the same CNT attached to a Ni carbide.
   The difference in total energy implies that a CNT should act as a sink
   for C atoms dissolved in the Ni carbide cluster, which means that the
   dissolved C atoms will be drained from the cluster, yielding a pure
   metal in the zero Kelvin thermodynamic limit. It is argued that this
   draining procedure is likely to occur even if carbon is added to the
   cluster at a proper rate, for example, during CNT growth.

AB We present a systematic study of electronic gap states in defected
   titania using our implementation of the Hubbard-U approximation in the
   grid-based projector-augmented wave density functional theory code,
   GPAW. The defects considered are Ti interstitials, O vacancies, and H
   dopants in the rutile phase of bulk titanium dioxide. We find that by
   applying a sufficiently large value for the Hubbard-U parameter of the
   Ti 3d states, the excess electrons localize spatially at the Ti sites
   and appear as states in the band gap. At U=2.5 eV, the position in
   energy of these gap states are in fair agreement with the experimental
   observations. In calculations with several excess electrons and U=2.5
   eV, all of these end up in gap states that are spatially localized
   around specific Ti atoms, thus effectively creating one Ti3+ ion per
   excess electron. An important result of this investigation is that
   regardless of which structural defect is the origin of the gap states,
   at U=2.5 eV, these states are found to have their mean energies within a
   few hundredths of an eV from 0.94 eV below the conduction band minimum.

AB We study the effect of temporal correlation in a Langevin equation
   describing nonadiabatic dynamics at metal surfaces. For a harmonic
   oscillator, the Langevin equation preserves the quantum dynamics exactly
   and it is demonstrated that memory effects are needed in order to
   conserve the ground state energy of the oscillator. We then compare the
   result of Langevin dynamics in a harmonic potential with a perturbative
   master equation approach and show that the Langevin equation gives a
   better description in the nonperturbative range of high temperatures and
   large friction. Unlike the master equation, this approach is readily
   extended to anharmonic potentials. Using density functional theory, we
   calculate representative Langevin trajectories for associative
   desorption of N(2) from Ru(0001) and find that memory effects lower the
   dissipation of energy. Finally, we propose an ab initio scheme to
   calculate the temporal correlation function and dynamical friction
   within density functional theory. (C) 2010 American Institute of

AB Many thiolate-protected gold clusters prepared by wet-chemistry show
   abundances of certain compositions which can be explained by the
   shell-closing of the superatom orbitals 1S, 1P, 1D, ... , leading to
   magic-number series 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 58, etc. One recently isolated
   such cluster, Au-44(SPh)(28)(2-), is a potential candidate for the magic
   number 18, although its structure has not been determined. Applying the
   "divide-and-protect" concept and recent knowledge obtained from the
   structures of Au-25(SR)(18)(-) and Au-102(SR)(44) (-SR being a thiolate
   group), we compare two structural models for the Au-44(SR)(28)(2-)
   cluster. We have optimized their structures, computed powder X-ray
   diffraction patterns and optical absorption spectra, and performed the
   superatom analysis on them. The model featuring the -RS-Au-SR- and
   -RS-Au-SR-Au-SR- motifs in the protective layer shows better energetic
   stability and agreement with the experimental XRD pattern than the other
   model which has a protective layer including longer, polymeric
   RS(AuSR)(x) motifs. However, the computed optical spectra for both
   models are quite different from the experimental one. Our models here
   can serve as benchmarks for further proposals of Au-44(SR)(28)(2-)
   cluster structures.

AB A particularly stable thiolate-protected gold nanocluster,
   Au-25(SR)(18), was structurally characterized from X-ray crystallography
   in 2008, and concomitantly its electronic and optical properties were
   analyzed via density functional theory. The robust geometry and a
   well-understood electronic structure of this cluster motivate
   explorations of properties of extended systems made out of Au-25(SR)(18)
   building blocks. As a first step in this direction, we analyze here
   structural, vibrational, electronic, and optical properties of the Au-25
   cluster anion as it was observed in the crystalline environment and
   predict properties of cluster dimers, where the Au-25 units are linked
   together. via an aromatic dithiolate linker. We show that properties of
   each Au-25 unit of the dimer can be quite independently modified from
   the other by doping with a nonmagnetic (Pd) or magnetic (Mn) metal atom.
   We anticipate that material systems with interesting properties could be
   made from these building blocks, provided that a suitable chemistry for
   their controlled linking can be found.

AB Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) has recently been introduced as a
   spectroscopic tool for molecular junctions where it offers the
   possibility to probe molecular level energies at relatively low bias
   voltages. In this work we perform extensive ab initio calculations of
   the nonlinear current-voltage relations for a broad class of
   single-molecule transport junctions in order to assess the applicability
   and limitations of TVS. We find, that in order to fully utilize TVS as a
   quantitative spectroscopic tool, it is important to consider asymmetries
   in the coupling of the molecule to the two electrodes. When this is
   taken properly into account, the relation between the transition voltage
   and the energy of the molecular orbital closest to the Fermi level
   closely follows the trend expected from a simple, analytical model.

AB We model a Kohn-Sham potential with the discontinuity at integer
   particle numbers starting from the approximation by (GLLB) Gritsenko et
   al. [Phys. Rev. A 51, 1944 (1995)]. We evaluate the Kohn-Sham gap and
   the discontinuity to obtain the quasiparticle gap. This allows us to
   compare the Kohn-Sham gaps to those obtained by accurate many-body
   perturbation-theory-based optimized potential methods. In addition, the
   resulting quasiparticle band gap is compared to experimental gaps. In
   the GLLB model potential, the exchange-correlation hole is modeled using
   a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) energy density and the
   response of the hole-to-density variations is evaluated by using the
   common-denominator approximation and homogeneous electron-gas-based
   assumptions. In our modification, we have chosen the PBEsol potential as
   the GGA to model the exchange hole and add a consistent correlation
   potential. The method is implemented in the GPAW code, which allows
   efficient parallelization to study large systems. A fair agreement for
   Kohn-Sham and the quasiparticle band gaps with semiconductors and other
   band gap materials is obtained with a potential which is as fast as GGA
   to calculate.

   are exothermic with respect to the gas-phase moieties, and the
   adsorption energy increases at steps. Our results show that the binding
   mechanism of CN(-) is different from that of CO. The projected LDOS
   indicates that the bond between the flat surface and CN shows very small
   overlap between metal and CN states. This overlap increases provided
   that extra charge is present or low-coordinated Au atoms are available.
   Charge transfer is analyzed via the Bader method and the Electron
   Localization Function. Both suggest that Au-CN bonding resembles that in
   the gas-phase [Au(CN)(2)](-), which has been identified as covalent. The
   present study justifies the mechanism described in the literature
   involving a first CN(-) adsorption, electron transfer to form AuCN, and
   second adsorption of a CN(-) to form the soluble species and dissolve
   gold atoms from low grade ores. (C)10 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Density functional calculations were performed in order to investigate
   CO oxidation on two of the most stable bulk PdO surfaces. The most
   stable PdO(100) surface, with oxygen excess, is inert against CO
   adsorption, whereas strong adsorption on the stoichiometric PdO(101)
   surface leads to favorable oxidation via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism. The reaction with a surface oxygen atom has an activation
   energy of 0.66 eV, which is comparable to the lowest activation energies
   observed on metallic surfaces. However, the reaction rate may be limited
   by the coverage of molecular oxygen. Actually, the reaction with the
   site blocking molecular oxygen is slightly more favorable, enabling also
   possible formation of carbonate surface species at low temperatures. The
   extreme activity of strongly bonded surface oxygen atoms is more greatly
   emphasized on the PdO(100)-O surface. The direct reaction without
   adsorption, following the Eley-Rideal mechanism and taking advantage of
   the reaction tunnel provided by the adjacent palladium atom, has an
   activation energy of only 0.24 eV. The reaction mechanism and activation
   energy for the palladium activated CO oxidation on the most stable
   PdO(100)-O surface are in good agreement with experimental observations.

   conformations which we attribute to different angular orientations of
   the rotator and which are locally stable states according to density
   functional theory calculations. Time-resolved tunneling current spectra
   showed that the rotator undergoes a torsional motion around the

AB The tribological performance of hydrogenated diamond-like carbon (DLC)
   coatings is studied by molecular dynamics simulations employing a
   screened reactive bond-order potential that has been adjusted to
   reliably describe bond-breaking under shear. Two types of DLC films are
   grown by CH(2) deposition on an amorphous substrate with 45 and 60 eV
   impact energy resulting in 45 and 30% H content as well as 50 and 30%
   sp(3) hybridization of the final films, respectively. By combining two
   equivalent realizations for both impact energies, a hydrogen-depleted
   and a hydrogen-rich tribo-contact is formed and studied for a realistic
   sliding speed of 20 m s(-1) and loads of 1 and 5 GPa. While the
   hydrogen-rich system shows a pronounced drop of the friction coefficient
   for both loads, the hydrogen-depleted system exhibits such kind of
   running-in for 1 GPa, only. Chemical passivation of the DLC/DLC
   interface explains this running-in behavior. Fluctuations in the
   friction coefficient occurring at the higher load can be traced back to
   a cold welding of the DLC/DLC tribo-surfaces, leading to the formation
   of a transfer film (transferred from one DLC partner to the other) and
   the establishment of a new tribo-interface with a low friction
   coefficient. The presence of a hexadecane lubricant leads to low
   friction coefficients without any running-in for low loads. At 10 GPa
   load, the lubricant starts to degenerate resulting in enhanced friction.

AB Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in
   many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the
   Kohn-Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies
   the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with
   several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector
   augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package
   (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid
   representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more
   traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space
   grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational
   scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique
   feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in
   addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to
   the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between
   the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one
   to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional
   theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have
   implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the
   linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport
   calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW
   using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In
   addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also
   describe the implementation of selected exchange-correlation
   functionals, parallelization schemes, Delta SCF-method, x-ray absorption
   spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.

   yields an excellent match between the computed (for R = C6H13) and
   measured (for R = C12H25) powder X-ray diffraction function. We
   interpret in detail the electronic structure of the Au-23 core by using
   a particle-in-a-cylinder model. Although the alkane thiolate ligands are
   achiral, the chiral structure of the ligand layer yields strong circular
   dichroism (CD) in the excitations below 2.2 eV for Au-38(SCH3)(24). Our
   calculated CD spectrum is in quantitative agreement with the previously
   measured low-energy CD signal of glutathione-protected Au-38(SG)(24).
   Our study demonstrates a new mechanism for the strong chiral response of
   thiolate-protected gold clusters with achiral metal cores and ligands.

AB Using first-principles calculations we analyze the electronic transport
   properties of a recently proposed anthraquinone-based electrochemical
   switch. Robust conductance on/off ratios of several orders of magnitude
   are observed due to destructive quantum interference present in the
   anthraquinone but absent in the hydroquinone molecular bridge. A simple
   explanation of the interference effect is achieved by transforming the
   frontier molecular orbitals into localized molecular orbitals thereby
   obtaining a minimal tight-binding model describing the transport in the
   relevant energy range in terms of hopping via the localized orbitals.
   The topology of the tight-binding model, which is dictated by the
   symmetries of the molecular orbitals, determines the amount of quantum
   interference. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

   efficient pseudopotential-like scheme for electronic-structure

   (HF) theory, demonstrating that the PAW-HF method is able to calculate
   valence energies with the same accuracy as the frozen-core orbital

AB Understanding the structure and conductance of the molecular Junction
   between benzene dithiolates (BDT)and gold electrodes has posed a classic
   unsolved problem for high-level theoretical work for over a decade.
   Recent breakthroughs for the gold-thiolate interface in
   thiolate-passivated gold clusters and in Au(111)/self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs) motivated us to reanalyze the properties of Au-BDT-Au
   junctions. We show that distinct molecular Au(SR)(2) and Au(2)(SR)(3)
   units, which are known to exist at the nanoparticle-thiolate and Au-SAM
   interfaces, define the properties of the electrode-molecule junction.
   These units can form multiple contacts. The junction can be stretched by
   more than 1 nm whereby alternating gold-thiolate chains are
   spontaneously formed in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The
   calculated conductance values for the BDT junctions agree with a wide
   range of reported experimental data. Our results give a solid ground for
   further theoretical studies of molecular junctions between gold and a
   wide variety of organic molecules containing dithiols.

AB The progress of ligand exchange reactions between the ligands of
   Au-25(SR)(18)(-) nanoparticles (SR = S(CH2)(2)Ph) and thiols with
   electron-withdrawing substituents (HSPh-p-X; X = Br, NO2) was monitored
   using nuclear magnetic resonance. As the reactions proceed, the
   introduction of the electron withdrawing SPhX ligands into the
   nanoparticle ligand shell causes a shift of the nanoparticle redox waves
   (Au25(1+/0)) and Au-25(0/1-)) to more positive potentials. Combining the
   NMR and electrochemical results reveals a nearly linear shift of the
   redox formal potentials as a function of the average number of exchanged
   ligands: similar to 42 and 25 mV/ligand for X = NO2 and Br,
   respectively. Using a simple model electron-withdrawing ligand
   (-SCH2Cl), density functional theory (DFT) was used to study in detail
   the effects on the nanoparticle electronic structure caused by exchange
   of this ligand for -SCH3. The calculations show how the electronegative
   X group changes the polarization of the nanoparticle and the
   chargedistribution among the ligands, the protecting (-SR-Au-SR-Au-SR)
   semirings, and the Au-13 core. The HOMO-LUMO gap is unchanged by the
   ligand exchanges; both states are equally stabilized by the presence of
   each incoming ligand, by 60 mV/ligand. Charge analysis suggests no
   significant changes in the Au-13 core, even after complete exchange.
   Rather, the charge is transferred inside the ligands, mostly from
   nearest-neighbor atoms of the semirings.

   corresponding calculations of Pd9 on a free-standing MgO(001) trilayer -
   a system that already reproduces the adsorption properties of thick MgO
   films. A 3D double trigonal antiprism is compared to a 2D fragment of a

   3D ground state on a thick MgO film is still energetically favourable on
   a thin metal supported MgO film - despite the substantial charge
   transfer from the metal support to the 2D cluster. Simulated scanning
   tunnelling microscopy images predict that the oxide formation should be
   easily detectable for negative bias voltages, since the highest occupied
   molecular orbitals of both the pristine as well as the oxidised clusters
   possess a strong Pd(d) contribution localised on the Pd atoms. At
   positive bias, the nodal structure of delocalised unoccupied orbitals
   sometimes masks the nuclear positions.

   there exist adsorption systems for which commonly used

AB Metal nanoparticles supported by thin films are important in the fields
   of molecular electronics, biotechnology and catalysis, among others.
   Penetration of these nanoparticles through their supporting films can be
   undesirable in some circumstances(1) but desirable in others(2-4), and
   is often considered to be a diffusive process. Here, we demonstrate a
   mechanism for the penetration of thin films and other nanoscopic
   barriers that is different from simple diffusion. Silver clusters that
   are soft-landed onto a monolayer of C-60 supported by gold sink through
   the monolayer in a matter of hours. However, the clusters are stable
   when landed onto two monolayers of C-60 supported on gold, or on one
   monolayer of C-60 supported on graphite. With backing from atomistic
   calculations, these results demonstrate that a metallic substrate exerts
   attractive forces on metallic nanoparticles that are separated from the
   substrate by a single monolayer.

   the terrace, the limits of low and monolayer coverage are explored. The
   metal support enhances the adsorption energies of isolated OH and H
   through electron exchange with the oxide/metal interface, forming either
   OH(-) or H(+). As a consequence, the nature of the bonding of
   dissociated H(2)O on MgO(100) is different as compared to that on
   MgO/Ag(100). The bonding on MgO(100) is governed by electron pairing in
   the oxide whereas bonding to MgO/Ag(100) is determined by the

AB Finely dispersed nanometre-scale gold particles are known to catalyse
   several oxidation reactions in aerobic, ambient conditions. The
   catalytic activity has been explained by various complementary
   mechanisms, including support effects, particle-size-dependent
   metal-insulator transition, charging effects, frontier orbital
   interactions and geometric fluxionality. We show, by considering a
   series of robust and structurally well-characterized ligand-protected
   gold clusters with diameters between 1.2 and 2.4 nm, that electronic
   quantum size effects, particularly the magnitude of the so-called
   HOMO-LUMO energy gap, has a decisive role in binding oxygen to the
   nano-catalyst in an activated form. This can lead to the oxidation
   reaction 2CO+O(2) -> 2CO(2) with low activation barriers. Binding of
   dioxygen is significant only for the smallest particles with a metal
   core diameter clearly below 2 nm. Our results suggest a potentially
   viable route to practical applications using ligand-protected gold
   clusters for green chemistry.

   the emergence of transmission sidebands when molecular vibrational modes
   are coupled to the electronic state mediating the transmission. We will
   show that if a molecule-metal junction is biased just below a molecular
   resonance, one may induce the transmission of a single electron by
   externally exciting a vibrational mode of the molecule. The analysis is
   quite general but requires that the molecular orbital does not hybridize
   strongly with the metallic states. As an example we perform a
   density-functional theory analysis of a benzene molecule between two
   Au(111) contacts and show that exciting a particular vibrational mode

   the rich variety of techniques used to solve these problems. The paper
   is intended for a diverse scientific computing audience. For this

   problems to be solved, their origin, and the methods used to solve tire
   resulting linear algebra or nonlinear optimization problems. It is
   common knowledge that the behavior of matter at the nanoscale is, in
   principle, entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. In practice,

   approximate versions of this equation, which allow one to study
   nontrivial systems, took about five or six decades to develop. In
   particular, the last two decades saw a Hurry of activity in developing
   effective software. One of the main practical variants of the
   Schrodinger equation is based on what is referred to as density
   functional theory (DFT). Tire combination of DFT with pseudopotentials
   allows one to obtain in an efficient way the ground state configuration
   for many materials. This article will emphasize pseudopotential-density

AB We calculate single-particle excitation energies for a series of 34
   molecules using fully self-consistent GW, one-shot G(0)W(0),
   Hartree-Fock (HF), and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). All
   calculations are performed within the projector-augmented wave method
   using a basis set of Wannier functions augmented by numerical atomic
   orbitals. The GW self-energy is calculated on the real frequency axis
   including its full frequency dependence and off-diagonal matrix
   elements. The mean absolute error of the ionization potential (IP) with
   respect to experiment is found to be 4.4, 2.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.5 eV for
   DFT-PBE, DFT-PBE0, HF, G(0)W(0) (HF), and self-consistent GW,
   respectively. This shows that although electronic screening is weak in
   molecular systems, its inclusion at the GW level reduces the error in
   the IP by up to 50% relative to unscreened HF. In general GW overscreens
   the HF energies leading to underestimation of the IPs. The best IPs are
   obtained from one-shot G(0)W(0) calculations based on HF since this
   reduces the overscreening. Finally, we find that the inclusion of
   core-valence exchange is important and can affect the excitation
   energies by as much as 1 eV.

AB Tuning of effective band gaps at insulator surfaces by adsorbed
   molecules is of fundamental interest but also technologically relevant
   for contact charging induced by adsorbed molecules like hydroxybenzoic
   acids. Our studies by density functional theory of the adsorption of
   benzoic acid (BA), salicylic acid (SA), and para-salicylic acid (p-SA)
   on perfect KCl and NaCl(100) surfaces as well as on polar and nonpolar
   step edges reveal the importance of polar defects in this context. We
   also found that the van der Waals dispersion contributes to about half
   of the adsorption energy in most cases. Therefore, the van der Waals
   interaction must be explicitly taken into account even for the
   interaction between molecules and wide band gap insulator surfaces,
   respective of the adsorption on flat or stepped surfaces. On the other
   hand, the adsorption geometry is still determined by short-range forces,
   that is, by the weak chemical bonds and electrostatic interactions.
   These short-range interactions are mostly mediated by resonant coupling
   between HOMO-1 and HOMO-2 molecular states and the valence band of the
   solid, which results in very similar adsorption energies of these
   molecules on the KCl and NaCl surfaces. The interaction strength is
   significantly modified only at defects with large dipole moments (e.g.,
   pairs of polar steps) resulting in split-off edge states below the
   valence band. Resonant coupling to these states leads to an almost rigid
   down-shift of all molecular orbitals that efficiently reduces the
   effective band gap at the Surface. As a result, an effective band gap of
   0.9 eV has been achieved oil the polar KCl [011] stepped Surface thanks
   to the relatively small HOMO-LUMO gap of SA.

AB We have investigated the adsorption of O-2 on Au-n clusters (n = 1-6)
   supported by an ultra thin (3ML)MgO(001) film on Mo metal via density
   functional theory calculations. On thin films, these small clusters have
   chain like structures and their electronic states resemble 1D quantum
   well states. The Au1-3 are charged by one electron whereas the larger
   Au4-6 get two electrons from the substrate. This is confirmed both by
   the symmetries of the HOMO and LUMO states of the clusters and the Bader
   charge analysis. In contrast to the O-2 adsorption on gas-phase
   clusters, the adsorption energy of O-2 molecule does not show pronounced
   oscillations as a function of cluster size. The O-2 is activated (i.e.
   the O-O bond is elongated and the molecule is charged) in contact with
   all the cluster sizes. O-2 activation and strong binding is also
   observed on bare MgO/Mo, whereas the molecule interacts only weakly with
   bulk MgO. The activation of O-2 is mainly due to charge transferred from
   the support. The relevance of these results for catalytic activity of
   small thin-film-supported clusters is discussed.

AB We present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the
   hydrogenation (HYD) and direct desulfurization (DDS) pathways of
   thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) over cobalt-promoted MoS2. We find
   that the Co-Mo-S edge in its equilibrium state under HDS conditions is
   reactive toward both hydrogenation and C-S bond scission without the
   initial creation of vacancies. This can be accomplished such that
   additional S is bound to the Co-Mo-S subsequent to C-S bond scission and
   then removed in the final reaction step. We find thus that
   coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) are present in the equilibrium
   structure, and at these sites HDS can take place without sulfur removal
   in the first step. No traditional vacancies are formed and the present
   mechanism is therefore very different from the previously proposed
   vacancy mechanisms requiring the initial creation of a sulfur vacancy
   for the reaction to proceed. We find that Co-promotion decreases the
   barrier of hydrogenation reactions and active site regeneration but
   increases the barrier of C-S-scission reactions. The net result of Co
   promotion is found to be an increase in the hydrogenation activity and
   also of the relative importance of the DDS pathway. We compare our
   results to available experimental information and find a number of
   consistencies and parallels. Therefore, we can rationalize the promoting
   effect of Co such that at the Co-Mo-S edge, good hydrogenation
   properties are combined with the ability to bind additional sulfur upon
   C-S-scission. Finally, we propose that the interactions between the
   Co-promoted S-edge and the non-promoted Mo-edge may play a role in the
   hydrogenation pathway. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   reactions at metal surfaces can be driven by multiple
   hot-electron-mediated excitations of adsorbates. A high transient
   density of hot electrons is obtained by means of femtosecond laser
   pulses and a characteristic feature of such experiments is the emergence
   of a power law dependence of the reaction yield on the laser fluence Y
   similar to F(n). We propose a model of multiple inelastic scattering by
   hot electrons which reproduces this power law and the observed exponents
   of several experiments. All parameters are calculated within density
   functional theory and the delta self-consistent field method. With a
   simplifying assumption, the power law becomes exact and we obtain a

   number of adsorbate vibrational states participating in the reaction.

   of the two representations for optimal performance. The implementation
   is tested by calculating atomization energies and equilibrium bulk

   The tail functions are Slater-type orbitals, which are localized,
   exponentially decaying functions. To solve the Poisson equation between
   spheres, we use a finite difference method replacing the rapidly varying
   charge density inside the spheres with a smoothed density with the same
   multipole moments. We use multigrid techniques oil the mesh, which
   yields the Coulomb potential on the spheres and in turn defines the

   within the adiabatic local-density approximation, we study the

   surface. The surface is modeled at two levels of approximation, first as
   a simple external potential and later as a 20-atom cluster. We perform a
   number of calculations on an electron hitting the adsorbed molecule from
   inside the surface and establish a picture, where the resonance is being
   probed by the hot electron. This enables us to extract the position of
   the resonance energy through a fitting procedure. It is demonstrated
   that with the model we can extract several properties of the system,
   such as the presence of resonance peaks, the time electrons stay on the
   molecule before returning to the surface when hitting a molecular
   resonance and the lowering of the resonance energy due to an image
   charge effect. Finally we apply the TDDFT procedure to only consider the

   nanowire, although the transmission of the s-d(z)(2) channel still
   exhibits even-odd oscillatory behavior. When the nanowires are deformed
   into zigzag configurations from the straight configuration, the
   oscillation behavior of the patterns with long periods changes and the
   oscillations eventually disappear. On the other hand, the even-odd
   oscillatory behavior of the s-d(z)(2) channel still survives even in the
   deformed nanowire. The even-odd oscillation in the conductance of Pt
   nanowire is interpreted to be due to the low sensitivity of the
   oscillation of the s-d(z)(2) channel to the spatial deformation of the
   nanowires.

AB Accurate calculations of adsorption energies of cyclic molecules are of
   key importance in investigations of, e.g., hydrodesulfurization (HDS)
   catalysis. The present density functional theory (DFT) study of a set of
   important reactants, products, and inhibitors in HDS catalysis
   demonstrates that van der Waals interactions are essential for binding
   energies on MoS2 surfaces and that DFT with a recently developed
   exchange-correlation functional (vdW-DF) accurately calculates the van
   der Waals energy. Values are calculated for the adsorption energies of
   butadiene, thiophene, benzothiophene, pyridine, quinoline, benzene, and
   naphthalene on the basal plane of MoS2, showing good agreement with
   available experimental data, and the equilibrium geometry is found as
   flat at a separation of about 3.5 A for all studied molecules. This
   adsorption is found to be due to mainly van der Waals interactions.
   Furthermore, the manifold of adsorption-energy values allows trend
   analyses to be made, and they are found to have a linear correlation
   with the number of main atoms.

AB The density functional theory is used to examine the electronic
   structure of small Au clusters, supported on rutile TiO2(110) surfaces
   having subsurface Ti-interstitials. The interstitials reduce the surface
   and we find that negatively charged gold clusters are stabilized with
   respect to the stoichiometric surface. The behavior of the open-shell
   gold clusters can be rationalized in terms of the highest occupied
   molecular orbitals and the resulting electron affinities. The relative
   stabilities of closed-shell gold clusters led to recent disagreements in
   the literature. We show that they are very dependent on the density
   functional used. As expected, a redshift in the CO stretch vibration is
   calculated for CO adsorbed on a negatively charged cluster. Somewhat
   surprisingly a larger redshift is found for CO adsorbed on an overall
   positively charged Au-3 cluster. This is explained by CO being a local
   probe of the individual Au charges and one Au atom having an electron
   accumulation.

   properties of methylthiolate-protected bimetal PdAu24(SR)(18)(z) (R =
   Me) clusters with various charge states (-3 <= z <= + 3) are
   investigated by using density functional theory. The results are
   compared to properties of the well-understood singly anionic pure gold
   complex Au-25(SR)(18)((-1)) [J. Akola, M. Walter, H. Hakkinen and H.
   Gronbeck, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130, 3756]. The atomic structure of
   this all-gold complex can be written in a "divide-and-protect'' way [ H.
   Hakkinen, M. Walter and H. Gronbeck, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 9927]
   as Au-13[Au-2(SR)(3)](6)((-1)) where 6 v-shaped Au-2(SR)(3) ligands
   protect the close-to-icosahedral Au-13 core and where eight delocalized
   metal electrons, derived from Au(6s) electrons, comprise a stable
   closed-shell 1S(2)1P(6) "superatom'' configuration in the core. We show
   that the di-anion PdAu24(SR)(18)((-2)) is a corresponding eight-electron
   closed-shell species whereas the clusters PdAu24(SR)(18)(z), -1 <= z <=
   + 3, have holes in the 1P HOMO manifold. This indicates that the doping
   Pd atom remains close to the zero-valent 4d(10)5s(0) configuration and
   does not contribute electrons to the delocalized electron density in the
   gold core. Structural optimization shows that the all-gold
   "divide-and-protect'' structure motif is robust with respect to
   replacing the Au by Pd at the center of the core, at the surface of the
   core or in one of the protecting Au-2(SR)(3) ligands. However, optical
   absorption and the HOMO-LUMO and electrochemical gaps depend sensitively
   on the site of the doping Pd atom, which may turn out be useful for
   assigning the structure of PdAu24(SR)(18) from experimental data.

   of the adsorption energy, the equilibrium geometry is still mostly
   determined by the chemical interaction between O and Na atoms. This
   seems to be due to a compensation effect of the vdW interaction in
   different parts of the planar SA molecule. The inclusion of the vdW
   interaction also results in a closer alignment of the highest occupied
   orbital of SA and the valence band maximum of NaCl(001) as a consequence
   of stronger hybridizations.

   faults occurring during the lifetime of a process. Checkpointing has
   been a popular method of providing fault tolerance in high-end systems.
   While considerable research has been done to optimize checkpointing, in

   this paper, we study the checkpointing overhead seen by applications
   running on leadership-class machines such as the IBM Blue Gene/P at
   Argonne National Laboratory. We study various applications and design a
   methodology to assist users in understanding and choosing checkpointing
   frequency and reducing the overhead incurred. In particular, we study
   three popular applications-the Grid-Based Projector-Augmented Wave
   application, the Carr-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics application-and a
   Nek5000 computational fluid dynamics application and analyze their
   memory usage and possible checkpointing trends on 32,768 processors of
   the Blue Gene/P system.

AB The ambient temperature equations of state (EoS) of iron, cobalt,
   nickel, zinc, molybdenum, and silver have been measured by x-ray
   diffraction. These transition metals were compressed using diamond anvil
   cells with a helium pressure transmitting medium. The maximum pressure
   reached during these experiments varied between 65 GPa (for cobalt) and
   200 GPa (for iron). This work completes previous measurements on six
   other metals [Phys. Rev. B 70, 094112 (2004)] to quantify the
   differences between ab initio calculations and experiment on a large
   experimental set of transition metals. The compression curves of iron,
   cobalt, nickel, zinc, molybdenum, silver, platinum, and gold are also
   calculated ab initio within the density-functional theory (DFT)
   formalism using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method and different
   exchange-correlation functionals (LDA, GGA-PBE, GGA-PBEsol). The
   difference between PAW and available all-electron calculations is found
   to be negligible up to very high pressures. The success of each
   exchange-correlation functional is correlated with the atomic number.
   For all metals, the bulk modulus becomes overestimated at high pressure.
   In addition, this extended data set of metals' EoS enables to reduce
   further, but marginally, the systematic uncertainty of the high-pressure
   metrology based on the ruby standard.

AB We present a modification of the Delta self-consistent field (Delta SCF)
   method of calculating energies of excited states in order to make it
   applicable to resonance calculations of molecules adsorbed on metal
   surfaces, where the molecular orbitals are highly hybridized. The Delta
   SCF approximation is a density-functional method closely resembling
   standard density-functional theory (DFT), the only difference being that
   in Delta SCF one or more electrons are placed in higher lying Kohn-Sham
   orbitals instead of placing all electrons in the lowest possible
   orbitals as one does when calculating the ground-state energy within
   standard DFT. We extend the Delta SCF method by allowing excited
   electrons to occupy orbitals which are linear combinations of Kohn-Sham
   orbitals. With this extra freedom it is possible to place charge locally
   on adsorbed molecules in the calculations, such that resonance energies
   can be estimated, which is not possible in traditional Delta SCF because
   of very delocalized Kohn-Sham orbitals. The method is applied to N(2),
   CO, and NO adsorbed on different metallic surfaces and compared to
   ordinary Delta SCF without our modification, spatially constrained DFT,
   and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy measurements. This comparison
   shows that the modified Delta SCF method gives results in close
   agreement with experiment, significantly closer than the comparable
   methods. For N(2) adsorbed on ruthenium (0001) we map out a
   two-dimensional part of the potential energy surfaces in the ground
   state and the 2 pi resonance. From this we conclude that an electron
   hitting the resonance can induce molecular motion, optimally with 1.5 eV
   transferred to atomic movement. Finally we present some performance test
   of the Delta SCF approach on gas-phase N(2) and CO in order to compare
   the results to higher accuracy methods. Here we find that excitation
   energies are approximated with accuracy close to that of time-dependent
   density-functional theory. Especially we see very good agreement in the
   minimum shift of the potential energy surfaces in the excited state
   compared to the ground state.

AB Synthesis, characterization, and functionalization of self-assembled,
   ligand-stabilized gold nanoparticles are long-standing issues in the
   chemistry of nanomaterials. Factors driving the thermodynamic stability
   of well documented discrete sizes are largely unknown. Herein, we
   provide a unified view of principles that underlie the stability of
   particles protected by thiolate (SR) or phosphine and halide (PR3, X)
   ligands. The picture has emerged from analysis of large-scale density
   functional theory calculations of structurally characterized compounds,
   namely Au-102(SR)(44), Au-39(PR3)(14)X-6(-), Au-11(PR3)(7)X-3, and
   Au-13(PR3)(10)X-2(3+), where X is either a halogen or a thiolate.
   Attributable to a compact, symmetric core and complete steric
   protection, each compound has a filled spherical electronic shell and a
   major energy gap to unoccupied states. Consequently, the exceptional
   stability is best described by a "noble-gas superatom" analogy. The
   explanatory power of this concept is shown by its application to many
   monomeric and oligomeric compounds of precisely known composition and
   structure, and its predictive power is indicated through suggestions
   offered for a series of anomalously stable cluster compositions which
   are still awaiting a precise structure determination.

AB We describe an implementation of density functional theory that is
   formulated fully in configuration space, where all wave functions,
   densities, and potentials are represented on a grid. Central to the
   method is a fourth-order factorization of the evolution operator for the
   Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Special attention is paid to nonlocal
   pseudopotentials of the Kleinman-Bylander type, which are necessary for
   a quantitatively accurate description of molecules, clusters, and
   solids. It is shown that the fourth-order factorization improves the
   computational efficiency of the method by about an order of magnitude
   compared with second-order schemes. We use the Ono-Hirose filtering
   method to reduce the resolution of the grid used for representing the
   wave functions. Some care is needed to maintain the fourth-order
   convergence using filtered projectors, and the necessary precautions are
   discussed. We apply the method to an isolated carbon atom as well as the
   carbon-monoxide molecule, the benzene molecule, and the
   buckminsterfullerene cluster, obtaining quantitative agreement with
   previous results. The convergence of the method with respect to time
   step, grid resolution, and filtering method is discussed in detail.

AB The electron-conduction properties of fullerene-based nanostructures
   suspended between electrodes are examined by first-principles
   calculations based on the density functional theory. The electron
   conductivity of the C-60-dimer bridge is low owing to the constraint of
   the junction of the molecules. When the fullerenes are doped electrons
   by being inserted Li atoms into the cages, the unoccupied state around
   the junction is filled and the conductivity can be significantly
   improved.

AB A scheme for the Fourier filtering of pseudopotentials in real space
   calculations is proposed, in order to reduce the artifact of positional
   energy dependence ("egg box" effect). It is based on an improved version
   of the mask function method poposed by Wang [Phys. Rev. B 64, 201107/1
   (2001)]. It is easy to implement, efficient, and accurate. By using
   atom-centered compensation charges, the local part of the
   pseudopotential becomes short ranged and can be filtered on the same
   footing as the nonlocal parts. A major advantage of the approach is that
   a generic set of parameters can be used for different pseudopotentials.
   A balanced parameter set is derived and validated. In this context a
   strategy to monitor the extent of grid dependence is introduced. It is
   found that, given a sufficiently fine grid spacing is used to represent
   the atomic valence density, the positional energy dependence can be
   reduced below 0.1 mhartree for all investigated atoms. On the example of
   a D-3h symmetric Si-5 cluster and the C-60 molecule it is demonstrated
   that the artificial symmetry breaking of both bond lengths and orbital
   energies can substantially be reduced by the filtering scheme. (c) 2006

AB We describe the algorithms we have developed for linear-scaling plane
   wave density functional calculations on parallel computers as
   implemented in the ONETEP program. We outline how ONETEP achieves plane
   wave accuracy with a computational cost which increases only linearly
   with the number of atoms by optimising directly the single-particle
   density matrix expressed in a psinc basis set. We describe in detail the
   novel algorithms we have developed for computing with the psinc basis
   set the quantities needed in the evaluation and optimisation of the
   total energy within our approach. For our parallel computations we use
   the general Message Passing Interface (MPI) library of subroutines to
   exchange data between processors. Accordingly, we have developed
   efficient schemes for distributing data and computational load to
   processors in a balanced manner. We describe these schemes in detail and
   in relation to our algorithms for computations with a psinc basis.
   Results of tests on different materials show that ONETEP is an efficient
   parallel code that should be able to take advantage of a wide range of
   parallel computer architectures. (c) 2006 WILEYNCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB A Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics implementation using real space
   discretized wavefunctions on equidistant Cartesian grids is presented.
   By using numerically discretized Laplace operators of higher order for
   the evaluation of the electronic kinetic energy as well as for the
   Poisson equation the total energy expression can be evaluated purely
   with local operations. Details of our implementation of microcanonical
   and canonical Car-Parrinello joint dynamics of nuclei and wavefunctions
   are described. For energy conserving molecular dynamics the exact
   partial derivatives of the energy expression with respect to the
   numerical wavefunctions must be available. This aspect is discussed for
   all contributions to the electronic energy. The crucial point is the
   efficient iterative solution of the Poisson equation. It is shown that
   energy conserving dynamics with real space wavefunctions is possible.
   Our object oriented code is fully parallelized and efficient also for
   the investigation of systems of realistic size. (c) 2006 WILEY-VCH

AB A characteristic feature of the state-of-the-art of real-space methods
   in electronic structure calculations is the diversity of the techniques
   used in the discretization of the relevant partial differential
   equations. In this context, the main approaches include
   finite-difference methods, various types of finite-elements and
   wavelets. This paper reports on the results of several code development
   projects that approach problems related to the electronic structure
   using these three different discretization methods. We review the ideas
   behind these methods, give examples of their applications, and discuss
   their similarities and differences. (c) 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB We present a practical scheme for performing error estimates for
   density-functional theory calculations. The approach, which is based on
   ideas from Bayesian statistics, involves creating an ensemble of
   exchange-correlation functionals by comparing with an experimental
   database of binding energies for molecules and solids. Fluctuations
   within the ensemble can then be used to estimate errors relative to
   experiment on calculated quantities such as binding energies, bond
   lengths, and vibrational frequencies. It is demonstrated that the error
   bars on energy differences may vary by orders of magnitude for different
   systems in good agreement with existing experience.
