Pulay Mixing
------------

The density is updated using Pulay-mixing [#Pulay1980]_, [#Kresse1996]_.

Special Metrics
---------------

Convergence is improved by an optimized metric `\hat{M}` for
calculation of scalar products in the mixing scheme, `\langle A | B
\rangle _s = \langle A | \hat{M} | B \rangle`, where `\langle \rangle
_s` is the scalar product with the special metric and `\langle
\rangle` is the usual scalar product.  The metric is based on the
rationale that contributions for small wave vectors are more important
than contributions for large wave vectors [#Kresse1996]_.  Using a
metric that weighs short wave density changes more than long wave
changes can reduce charge sloshing significantly.

It has been found [#Kresse1996]_ that the metric

.. math::

  \hat{M} = \sum_q | q \rangle f_q \langle q |, \quad f_q =
  1 + \frac{w}{q^2}

is particularly usefull (`w` is a suitably choosen weight).

This is easy to apply in plane wave codes, as it is local in reciprocal space.
Expressed in real space, this metric is

.. math::

  \hat{M} = \sum_{R R'} | R \rangle f(R' - R) \langle R' |, \quad f(R) =
  \sum_q f_q e^{i q R}

As this is fully nonlocal in real space, it would be very costly to apply.
Instead we use a semilocal stencil with only 3rd nearest neighbors:

.. math::

  f(R) = \begin{cases}
  1 + w/8 & R = 0 \\
  w / 16 & R = \text{nearest neighbor dist.} \\
  w / 32 & R = \text{2nd nearest neighbor dist.} \\
  w / 64 & R = \text{3rd nearest neighbor dist.} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}

which correspond to the reciprocal space metric

.. math::

  f_q = 1 + \frac{w}{8} (1 + \cos q_x + \cos q_y + \cos q_z +
  \cos q_x \cos q_y + \cos q_y \cos q_z + \cos q_x \cos q_z +
  \cos q_x \cos q_y \cos q_z)

With the nice property that it is a monotonously decaying function
from `f_q = w + 1` at `q = 0` to `f_q = 1` anywhere at the zone
boundary in reciprocal space.

A comparison of the two metrics is displayed in the figure below

Specifying a Mixing Scheme in GPAW
----------------------------------

Specifying the mixing scheme and metric is done using the ``mix``
keyword of the GPAW calculator::

  from gpaw import GPAW, Mixer
  calc = GPAW(mix=Mixer(beta=0.1, nmaxold=5, metric='new', weight=100))

which is the recommended value if the default fails to converge.

The class ``Mixer`` indicates one of the possible mixing schemes.  The
Pulay mixing can be based on:

1. The spin densities seperately, ``Mixer``
2. The total density, ``MixerSum2``
3. Spin channels seperately for the density matrices, and the summed
   channels for the pseudo electron density, ``MixerSum``
4. The total density and magnetization densities seperately, ``MixerDif``

Where the magnetization density is the difference between the two spin
densities.

All mixer classes takes the arguments ``(beta=0.25, nmaxold=3,
metric=None, weight=50.0)``. In addition, the ``MixerDif`` also takes
the arguments ``(beta_m=0.7, nmaxold_m=2, metric_m=None,
weight_m=10.0)`` which is the corresponding mixing parameters for the
magnetization density.

Here ``beta`` is the linear mixing coefficient, ``nmaxold`` is the
number of old densities used, ``metric`` is either ``None`` or
``'new'`` as described in `Special Metrics`_, and ``weight`` is the
weight used by the metric, if any.
