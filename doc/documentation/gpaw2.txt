AB Magnetic properties of a large assembly of ultrathin graphitic particles
   obtained by heavy sonication of graphite powder dispersed in
   N-methylpyrrolidone were measured by electron-spin resonance (ESR). The
   ESR signal was decomposed into one narrow and one broad component. The
   narrow component was associated with localized Curie-type defects. The
   temperature dependence of the predominant broad component points to a
   transition to a superparamagnetic-like state at 25 K. By performing the
   density-functional-theory calculations for graphene with selected
   extended defects (the sheet edges, zigzag chains of chemisorbed H atoms,
   and pentagon-octagon rows), we found considerable magnetic moments at C
   atoms in their vicinities. We attribute the magnetism in the graphitic
   particles to the localized electronic states near the defects in the
   network of the p electrons of graphene. The ferromagnetic (FM)
   correlations among magnetic moments at carbon atoms near the edges are
   not able to give rise to a long-range FM order.

   theory, the dependence of the reaction temperature of catalyzed carbon
   monoxide oxidation on the oxidation state of Pd-13 clusters deposited on
   MgO surfaces grown on Mo(100) is explored. It is shown that molecular
   oxygen dissociates easily on the supported Pd-13 cluster, leading to
   facile partial oxidation to form Pd13O4 clusters with C-4 nu symmetry.
   Increasing the oxidation temperature to 370 K results in nonsymmetric
   Pd13O6 clusters. The higher symmetry, partially oxidized cluster is
   characterized by a relatively high activation energy for catalyzed
   combustion of the first CO molecule via a reaction of an adsorbed CO
   molecule with one of the oxygen atoms of the Pd13O4 cluster. Subsequent
   reactions on the resulting lower-symmetry Pd13Ox (x < 4) clusters entail
   lower activation energies. The nonsymmetric Pd13O6 clusters show lower
   temperature-catalyzed CO combustion, already starting at cryogenic

AB Building on results for the adsorption of benzene on Pt(111), the

   theory. Benzaldehyde is found to chemisorb preferentially with its
   aromatic ring in the flat-lying bridge geometry that is also preferred
   for benzene. Across the investigated geometries, adsorption is
   homogeneously weakened compared to corresponding benzene geometries.
   This is found to be true for very different adsorption modes, namely,
   eta(6) and eta(8) modes, the latter having metal atoms inserted in the
   carbonyl bond. Reorientation and diffusion of benzaldehyde is found to
   have low energy barriers. Aggregation of molecules in dimers bound by
   aryl C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds is
   investigated, and specific configurations are found to be up to 0.15 eV
   more favorable than optimally configured, separated adsorbates. The
   binding is significantly stronger than what is found for gas phase
   dimers, suggesting an enhancing effect of the metal interaction. (C)

AB The kinetics of acetylene adsorption and cyclotrimerization was studied
   by vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) and density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations. At low temperature, SFG shows two
   resonances corresponding to acetylene adsorbed in two different sites.
   Upon heating, two new vibrational resonances appear. We interpret these
   resonances as being due to C2H2 island formation and adsorbed C4H4,
   which is the intermediate in the subsequent cyclotrimerization reaction
   to form benzene. A kinetic model is applied, which allows determination
   of the relevant activation barriers. The barrier for C2H2 diffusion is
   determined to be 43 +/- 1 kJ/mol. The activation barrier for formation
   of the C4H4 intermediate is found to be 84 +/- 6 kJ/mol and the barrier
   for benzene formation 5 +/- 3 kJ/mol lower. Barriers to diffusion and
   formation of C4H4 and C6H6 obtained from DFT calculations are in
   quantitative agreement with the experiments once the locally high

   couplings in graphene for the transverse and longitudinal acoustic
   phonons. Analytic forms of the coupling matrix elements valid in the
   long-wavelength limit are found to give an almost quantitative
   description of the first-principles matrix elements even at shorter
   wavelengths. Using the analytic forms of the coupling matrix elements,
   we study the acoustic phonon-limited carrier mobility and quasiparticle
   lifetime observable in photoemission spectroscopy for temperatures 0-200
   K and high carrier densities of 10(12)-10(13) cm(-2). We find that the
   intrinsic effective acoustic deformation potential of graphene is
   Xi(eff) = 6.8 eV and that the temperature dependence of the mobility mu
   similar to T-alpha in the Bloch-Gruneisen regime increases beyond an
   alpha = 4 dependence even in the absence of screening when the true
   coupling matrix elements are considered. The alpha > 4 temperature
   dependence of the mobility is found to originate in a similar
   temperature dependence of the relaxation time at the Fermi level. The
   large disagreement between our calculated deformation potential and
   those extracted from experimental measurements (18-29 eV) indicates that
   additional or modified acoustic phonon-scattering mechanisms are at play
   in experimental situations.

AB In-plane dislocation networks arise in both inorganic and organic films
   as a way of relieving the elastic strain that builds up at the substrate
   interface. In molecule/surface systems, supramolecular interactions are
   weak and more complex (compared to the atomic bonds in inorganic films),
   and their interplay with molecule-substrate interactions is very subtle,
   making it difficult to single out the driving force for a nanoscale
   dislocation pattern. On the basis of a combined experimental and
   theoretical work, we here show that periodic dislocations in a molecular
   PFP film are mainly driven by the optimization of molecule-substrate
   interactions. Compared to inorganic networks however, it implies a much
   lower energy imbalance, allowing a thermally induced transition from a
   low-energy strain dislocation pattern to a high-energy incommensurate

   the meta-GGA functional predicts the experimentally observed attractive
   intermolecular interactions within the SAMs. In particular, the use of
   M06-L yields an increased stability of the SAMs with increasing alkyl
   chain length and an increased attractive interaction between RS-Au-SR

   catalyst with the goals of understanding the nature of halide poisoning
   and evaluating the number and nature of the catalytic active sites. A
   series of eight poisoned catalysts were prepared by impregnating the
   parent catalyst with methanolic solutions of NaBr. Each catalyst was
   tested with CO oxidation catalysis under differential reactor
   conditions; O-2 reaction orders and Arrhenius activation energies were
   determined for each material. All of the kinetic data, including a
   Michaelis-Menten analysis, indicated that the primary effect of adding
   NaBr was to reduce the number of catalytically active sites. Density
   functional theory calculations, employed to evaluate likely binding
   sites for NaBr, showed that NaBr binds more strongly to Au corner and
   edge atoms than it does to the titania support or to exposed Au face
   atoms. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, along with a Temkin
   analysis of the data, was also used to evaluate changes to the catalyst
   upon NaBr deposition. These studies suggested that NaBr addition induces
   some subtle changes in the coverage dependent properties of CO
   adsorption, but that these did not substantially impact the CO coverage
   of the CO binding sites. The experimental and computational results are
   discussed in terms of possible poisoning mechanisms (site-blocking vs
   off-site binding and modification); the nature and number of active
   sites are also discussed in the context of the results.

   MoS2 for temperatures T > 100 K. The materials properties including the

   deformation potentials and Frohlich interaction in single-layer MoS2 are
   established. The calculated room-temperature mobility of similar to 410
   cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) is found to be dominated by optical phonon scattering
   via intra and intervalley deformation potential couplings and the
   Frohlich interaction. The mobility is weakly dependent on the carrier
   density and follows a mu similar to T-gamma temperature dependence with
   gamma = 1.69 at room temperature. It is shown that a quenching of the
   characteristic homopolar mode, which is likely to occur in top-gated
   samples, increases the mobility with similar to 70 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and
   can be observed as a decrease in the exponent to. = 1.52. In comparison
   to recent experimental findings for the mobility in single-layer MoS2
   (similar to 200 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)), our results indicate that mobilities

   electronic and phononic quantum transport in nanoscale thermoelectrics
   with examples focused on a new class of devices where a single organic
   molecule is attached to two metallic zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs)
   via highly transparent contacts. Such contacts make possible injection
   of evanescent wavefunctions from the ZGNR electrodes, so that their
   overlap within the molecular region generates a peak in the electronic
   transmission around the Fermi energy of the device. Additionally, the
   spatial symmetry properties of the transverse propagating states in the
   semi-infinite ZGNR electrodes suppress hole-like contributions to the
   thermopower. Thus optimized thermopower, together with diminished phonon
   thermal conductance in a ZGNR|molecule|ZGNR inhomogeneous
   heterojunctions, yields the thermoelectric figure of merit ZTa parts per
   thousand integral 0.4 at room temperature with maximum ZTa parts per
   thousand integral 3 reached at very low temperatures Ta parts per
   thousand integral 10 K (so that the latter feature could be exploited
   for thermoelectric cooling of, e.g., infrared sensors). The reliance on
   evanescent mode transport and symmetry of propagating states in the
   electrodes makes the electronic-transport-determined power factor in
   this class of devices largely insensitive to the type of sufficiently
   short organic molecule, which we demonstrate by showing that both
   18-annulene and C10 molecule sandwiched by the two ZGNR electrodes yield
   similar thermopower. Thus, one can search for molecules that will
   further reduce the phonon thermal conductance (in the denominator of ZT)
   while keeping the electronic power factor (in the nominator of ZT)
   optimized. We also show how the often employed Brenner empirical
   interatomic potential for hydrocarbon systems fails to describe phonon
   transport in our single-molecule nanojunctions when contrasted with
   first-principles results obtained via NEGF-DFT methodology.

AB An implementation of full self-consistency over the electronic density
   in the DFT + DMFT framework on the basis of a plane wave-projector
   augmented wave (PAW) DFT code is presented. It allows for an accurate
   calculation of the total energy in DFT + DMFT within a plane wave
   approach. In contrast to frameworks based on the maximally localized
   Wannier function, the method is easily applied to f electron systems,
   such as cerium, cerium oxide (Ce2O3) and plutonium oxide (Pu2O3). In
   order to have a correct and physical calculation of the energy terms, we
   find that the calculation of the self-consistent density is mandatory.
   The formalism is general and does not depend on the method used to solve
   the impurity model. Calculations are carried out within the Hubbard I
   approximation, which is fast to solve, and gives a good description of
   strongly correlated insulators. We compare the DFT + DMFT and DFT + U
   solutions, and underline the qualitative differences of their converged
   densities. We emphasize that in contrast to DFT + U, DFT + DMFT does not
   break the spin and orbital symmetry. As a consequence, DFT + DMFT

AB Geometry, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of
   methylthiolate-stabilized Au25L18 and MnAu24L18 (L = SCH3) clusters
   adsorbed on noble-metal (111) surfaces have been investigated by using
   spin-polarized density functional theory computations. The interaction
   between the cluster and the surface is found to be mediated by charge
   transfer mainly from or into the ligand monolayer. The electronic
   properties of the 13-atom metal core remain in all cases rather
   undisturbed as compared to the isolated clusters in gas phase. The
   Au25L18 cluster retains a clear highest occupied molecular
   orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap in the range of
   0.7 to 1.0 eV depending on the surface. The ligand layer is able to
   decouple the electronic structure of the magnetic MnAu24L18 cluster from
   the Au(111) surface, retaining a high local spin moment of close to 5
   mu(B) arising from the spin-polarized Mn(3d) electrons. These
   computations imply that the thiolate monolayer-protected gold clusters
   may be used as promising building blocks with tunable energy gaps,
   tunneling barriers, and magnetic moments for applications in the area of

   the density functional theory is extended to include the van der Waals
   interaction. We compare adsorption onto two model surfaces of SnO2,
   oxygen rich (stoichiometric) and oxygen poor (reduced), considered as
   limiting cases of varying oxygen abundance. With the chosen van der
   Waals approach [M. Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schroder, D. C. Langreth, and B.
   I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] it is found that on
   the stoichiometric surface, where binding has both a covalent nature and
   an ionic nature, with the addition of the van der Waals interaction the
   adsorption energy becomes somewhat stronger. However, on the reduced
   surface, where binding was earlier predicted to be more
   physisorptionlike by using a standard generalized gradient approximation
   (GGA) approach, the van der Waals interaction increases the adsorption
   energy by a larger factor. Furthermore, three different local-density
   approximation and GGA functionals are compared, as corrected with the
   van der Waals scheme. It is found that the correction brings those three
   to reasonably similar descriptions of adsorption on both surfaces.

   recorded at similar to 200 K revealed the diffusion of ethanol molecules
   both parallel and perpendicular to the rows of surface Ti atoms. The
   diffusion of ethanol molecules perpendicular to the rows of surface Ti
   atoms was found to be mediated by H adatoms in the rows of bridge-bonded
   O (O-br) atoms similarly to previous results obtained for water
   monomers. In contrast, the diffusion of H adatoms across the Ti rows,

   why the diffusion of H adatoms across the Ti rows mediated by ethanol

AB We investigate the interaction between water molecules and gold
   nanoclusters Au(n) through a systematic density functional theory study
   within both the generalized gradient approximation and the nonlocal van
   der Waals (vdW) density functional theory. Both planar (n = 6-12) and
   three-dimensional (3D) clusters (n = 17-20) are studied. We find that
   applying vdW density functional theory leads to an increase in the Au-Au
   bond length and a decrease in the cohesive energy for all clusters
   studied. We classify water adsorption on nanoclusters according to the
   corner, edge, and surface adsorption geometries. In both corner and edge
   adsorptions, water molecule approaches the cluster through the O atom.
   For planar clusters, surface adsorption occurs in a O-up/H-down geometry
   with water plane oriented nearly perpendicular to the cluster. For 3D
   clusters, water instead favors a near-flat surface adsorption geometry
   with the water O atom sitting nearly atop a surface Au atom, in
   agreement with previous study on bulk surfaces. Including vdW
   interaction increases the adsorption energy for the weak surface
   adsorption but reduces the adsorption energy for the strong corner
   adsorption due to increased water-cluster bond length. By analyzing the
   adsorption induced charge rearrangement through Bader's charge
   partitioning and electron density difference and the orbital interaction
   through the projected density of states, we conclude that the bonding
   between water and gold nanocluster is determined by an interplay between
   electrostatic interaction and covalent interaction involving both the
   water lone-pair and in-plane orbitals and the gold 5d and 6s orbitals.
   Including vdW interaction does not change qualitatively the physical
   picture but does change quantitatively the adsorption structure due to
   the fluxionality of gold nanoclusters. (C) 2012 American Institute of

   nonmodified surface, introduction of H-2 at a background pressure of

   structures followed by the gradual removal of all TFAP-related images.

AB Linear sp-hybridized carbon chains have recently been proposed as
   one-dimensional nanostructures for electronic applications and as
   intermediate products in many nanoscale processes. However, their
   synthesis and observation are affected by their degradation upon oxygen
   exposure. Carbon chains consisting of alternating single and triple
   bonds (polyynic) are reported to be more stable than those consisting of
   double bonds (cumulenic), but the details of the degradation mechanism
   are still unknown. We use density functional theory to show that
   adsorption of O(2) on carbon chains anchored to carbon substrates can
   cause their cleavage through the collective scission of O-O and C-C
   bonds, yielding separate CO-terminated chains. Further O(2) attack
   progressively shortens them, causing CO(2) formation. While the
   shortening process has general validity, the cleavage step of the
   reaction is exothermic for cumulenic chains only. Perturbations of the
   ideal structure, such as bending of the chains or modifications to the
   structure of their termination, affect the oxidation mechanism and can
   make the cleavage reaction exothermic for polyynic chains as well. These
   results contribute to the interpretation of the available experimental
   results and reveal atomic-scale details of the oxidation process,. thus
   allowing predictions on the chemistry of nanostructured carbon surfaces
   and suggesting possible new directions for the study of the chemical
   stability of carbynoid structures.

AB The structure of liquid water at ambient conditions is studied in ab
   initio molecular dynamics simulations in the NVE ensemble using van der
   Waals (vdW) density-functional theory, i.e., using the new
   exchange-correlation functionals optPBE-vdW and vdW-DF2, where the
   latter has softer nonlocal correlation terms. Inclusion of the more
   isotropic vdW interactions counteracts highly directional hydrogen
   bonds, which are enhanced by standard functionals. This brings about a
   softening of the microscopic structure of water, as seen from the
   broadening of angular distribution functions and, in particular, from
   the much lower and broader first peak in the oxygen-oxygen
   pair-correlation function (PCF) and loss of structure in the outer
   hydration shells. Inclusion of vdW interactions is shown to shift the
   balance of resulting structures from open tetrahedral to more
   close-packed. The resulting O-O PCF shows some resemblance with
   experiment for high-density water (Soper, A. K.; Ricci, M.A. Phys. Rev.
   Lett. 2000, 84, 2881), but not directly with experiment for ambient
   water. Considering the accuracy of the new functionals for interaction
   energies, we investigate whether the simulation protocol could cause the
   deviation. An O-O PCF consisting of a linear combination of 70% from
   vdW-DF2 and 30% from low-density liquid water, as extrapolated from
   experiments, reproduces near-quantitatively the experimental O-O PCF for
   ambient water. This suggests the possibility that the new functionals
   maybe reliable and that instead larger-scale simulations in the NPT
   ensemble, where the density is allowed to fluctuate in accordance with
   proposals for supercooled water, could resolve the apparent discrepancy
   with the measured PCF.

AB Non-aqueous Li-air or Li-O-2 cells show considerable promise as a very
   high energy density battery couple. Such cells, however, show sudden
   death at capacities far below their theoretical capacity and this, among
   other problems, limits their practicality. In this paper, we show that
   this sudden death arises from limited charge transport through the
   growing Li2O2 film to the Li2O2-electrolyte interface, and this
   limitation defines a critical film thickness, above which it is not
   possible to support electrochemistry at the Li2O2-electrolyte interface.
   We report both electrochemical experiments using a reversible internal
   redox couple and a first principles metal-insulator-metal charge
   transport model to probe the electrical conductivity through Li2O2 films
   produced during Li-O-2 discharge. Both experiment and theory show a
   "sudden death" in charge transport when film thickness is similar to 5
   to 10 nm. The theoretical model shows that this occurs when the
   tunneling current through the film can no longer support the
   electrochemical current. Thus, engineering charge transport through
   Li2O2 is a serious challenge if Li-O-2 batteries are ever to reach their
   potential. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

   diamond surfaces undergo an amorphization process, while an sp(3) to
   sp(2) conversion takes place in tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) and
   amorphous hydrocarbon (a-C:H) surface layers. Upon separation of the
   sliding samples, the interface fails. A rather smooth failure occurs for
   a-C:H, where the hydrogen atoms present in the bulk passivate the
   chemically active carbon dangling bonds. Conversely, sp-hybridized
   carbon chains are observed to form on diamond and ta-C surfaces. These
   carbynoid structures are known to undergo a fast degradation process
   when in contact with oxygen. Using quantum-accurate density functional
   theory simulations, we present a possible mechanism for the
   oxygen-induced degradation of the carbon chains, leading to oxidative
   wear of the sp phase on diamond and ta-C surfaces upon exposure to air.
   Oxygen molecules chemisorb on C-C bonds of the chains, triggering the
   cleavage of the chains through concerted O-O and C-C bond-breaking
   reactions. A similar reaction caused by adsorption of water molecules on
   the carbon chains is ruled out on energetic grounds. Further O-2
   adsorption causes the progressive shortening of the resulting,
   O-terminated, chain fragments through the same O-O and C-C bond breaking
   mechanism accompanied by the formation of CO2 molecules.

   Specifically, the two most stable < 001 > and < 1 (1) over bar1 > step
   edges are considered. By employing an automated genetic algorithm that
   samples a large number of candidates for each step edge, more stable,
   reconstructed structures were found for the < 1 (1) over bar1 > step
   edge, while the bulk truncated structures were recovered for the < 001 >
   step edge. We demonstrate how oxygen vacancies along these defects have
   lower formation energies than on flat terraces and how water and
   methanol molecules adsorb dissociatively on reduced < 1 (1) over bar1 >
   step edges. Our findings are in agreement with earlier experimental
   results and indicate an important contribution from step edges to the
   reactivity of the TiO2(110) surface.

AB The calculation of the electronic conductance of nanoscale junctions
   from first principles is a long-standing problem in the field of charge
   transport. Here we demonstrate excellent agreement with experiments for
   the transport properties of the gold/alkanediamine benchmark system when
   electron-electron interactions are described by the many-body GW
   approximation. The conductance follows an exponential length dependence:
   G(n) = G(c) exp(-beta n). The main difference from standard density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations is a significant reduction of the
   contact conductance, G(c), due to an improved alignment of the molecular
   energy levels with the metal Fermi energy. The molecular orbitals
   involved in the tunneling process comprise states delocalized over the
   carbon backbone and states localized on the amine end groups. We find
   that dynamic screening effects renormalize the two types of states in
   qualitatively different ways when the molecule is inserted in the
   junction. Consequently, the GW transport results cannot be mimicked by
   DFT calculations employing a simple scissors operator.

AB The conductance of a molecular wire connected to metallic electrodes is
   known to be sensitive to the atomic structure of the molecule-metal
   contact. This contact is to a large extent determined by the anchoring
   group linking the molecular wire to the metal. It has been found
   experimentally that a dumbbell construction with C(60) molecules acting
   as anchors yields more well-defined conductances as compared to the
   widely used thiol anchoring groups. Here, we use density functional
   theory to investigate the electronic properties of this dumbbell
   construction. The conductance is found to be stable against variations
   in the detailed bonding geometry and in good agreement with the
   experimental value of G = 3 x 10(-4) G(0). Electron tunneling across the
   molecular bridge occurs via the lowest unoccupied orbitals of C(60)
   which are pinned close to the Fermi energy due to partial charge
   transfer. Our findings support the original motivation to achieve
   conductance values more stable towards changes in the structure of the
   molecule-metal contact leading to larger reproducibility in experiments.

   the bulk PdO(100), PdO(101), Pd(100), and Pd(100) supported PdO(101)
   monolayer surfaces were also examined. The PdO(101)@:Pd(100) boundary
   enables several new routes for methane dissociation compared to the bulk
   surfaces, the lowest activation energy barrier being 0.8 eV. The barrier
   on the most stable and dominant bulk PdO(100) surface is as high as 1.2
   eV, whereas on the lower proportion bulk PdO(101) surface it is only 0.5
   eV. However, the corresponding barrier increases to 1.2 eV in the case
   of supported PdO(101) monolayer. A low activation energy of 0.7 eV is
   observed also on the Pd(100) surface, however, the reaction enthalpy on
   the metal surface is not as favored as on oxide surfaces or at the phase
   boundary. Hydrogen diffusion from metal to oxide phase can improve the
   reaction enthalpy, but it causes increase in the total activation
   energy. Overall, the results indicate that the presence of phase
   boundary between PdO and Pd enhances the activity in methane combustion,

   state, a sp(z) surface state, and B sigma(2) and sigma(3) quantum well
   states, which are 90% localized in the topmost B layer. Our results
   demonstrate that by charging the B atomic layer, either by changing the
   surface termination or through electro-chemical doping, the B sigma
   surface states are shifted down in energy, filled, and delocalize
   through hybridization as they cross the bulk MgB2 bulk bands. On the

   briefly presents nonspectral (pseudospectral and grid) methods to solve

   vibrational and electronic problems. Pseudospectral and grid methods
   facilitate parallelization, which is of critical importance for modern
   material modeling applications. By obviating the need to choose basis
   functions for which exact integrals are possible, they also enable one
   to use smaller basis sets. For the vibrational problem, pseudospectral

   vibrational spectrum without a potential surface, simply from values of
   the potential at points. This is possible if optimized basis functions

   surface has been investigated using a fully relaxed, self-consistent
   meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) density functional
   theory setup with the M06-L functional. The meta-GGA based
   molecule-surface separations are shortened and the adsorption bond
   strengths of the molecules are greatly improved over the virtually
   non-interacting results obtained when using a plain GGA
   exchange-correlation functional. The nucleobases containing oxygen atoms
   show higher corrugation with adsorption site and orientation than the
   other aromatic molecules considered. The adsorption of pentacene is
   studied on Au, Ag, and Cu surfaces. In agreement with experiment, the
   adsorption energies are found to increase with decreasing nobleness, but
   the dependency is underestimated. We point out how the kinetic energy
   density can discriminate between covalent and non-covalent bonding
   regions of orbital overlap. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB Effects of atomic layer deposited (ALD) aluminum oxide barriers on
   electron injection, recombination reactions, and efficiency of
   dye-sensitized solar cells were studied. The amorphous AlO(x)
   submonolayers prepared on nanocrystalline 2 mu m thick TiO(2) anatase
   film were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy. Time-of-flight elastic recoil detection method was employed
   to study the growth of similar AlO(x) layers on planar anatase films.
   Density functional theory calculations of the first ALD cycle over a
   (101) anatase surface revealed atomic scale roughness of the deposited
   layer owing to unequal adsorption sites and lateral repulsions between
   adsorbed precursor molecules. Calculations also indicate that the holes
   in the first AlO(x) layer allow triiodide but not the ruthenium
   bipyridyl sensitizer to reach the TiO(2) surface. After the first
   deposition cycle the dye binds to AlO(x) and is in average about 0.2 nm
   farther from the TiO(2) surface than when binding to the bare TiO(2)
   surface. Increase in average distance between the dye and TiO(2) surface
   was considered as the main reason for reduced electron injection
   efficiency observed for all coated sensitized films. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy indicated that also recombination reactions of
   the conduction band electrons with the electrolyte triiodide molecules
   were reduced. The exponential increase in charge transfer resistance at
   the dye-TiO(2)-electrolyte interface as a function of the number of ALD
   cycles indicated that AlO(x) barrier layers affect recombination mainly
   through the tunnel barrier mechanism. Decrease of both the short circuit
   current and efficiency of the solar cells prepared from above-mentioned
   films as the number of ALD cycles was increased suggests that the
   suppression of the recombination could not compensate for the
   barrier-induced losses of electron injection.

AB Soft-landed adsorption of Au-16 on bilayered graphene is investigated
   using density functional theory. The orientation of the Au-16 cluster
   and number of neighboring surface vacancies affect the overall
   structural and electronic properties of the cluster. The results of the
   PBE, vdW-DF, and vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functionals are compared
   for the cluster-substrate interaction for systems with and without
   defects. In the presence of defects size two and greater, an Au atom
   adsorbs into the topmost graphene layer; this strongly influences the
   binding energy (>3 eV), while inducing substantial bending in the carbon
   plane and altering electronic properties of the system. Though the
   T-d-symmetry and electronegative properties of the Au-16 structure
   change in the presence of greater neighboring defects, elements of the
   cagelike starting structure remain throughout. The electron localization
   function shows that the in-plane Au-C bonds are of delocalized
   (metallic) nature and there is a local charge transfer to the
   coordinating Au. However, the net charge transfer between adsorbate and
   substrate is considerable only for the defect-free case (0.8e to Au-16).
   Finally, the binding of O-2 molecules to the adsorbed Au-16 cluster is
   used to probe the potential catalytic activity of graphite and carbon
   nanotube systems, and in one case (for defect size two) the adsorbed O-2
   switches on the catalytically active superoxo-state.

AB Os(II)/(III) and Co(II)/(III) polypyridine complexes in aqueous solution
   are robust molecular entities both in freely solute state and adsorbed
   on Au(111)- and Pt(111)-electrode surfaces. This class of robust
   coordination chemical compounds have recently been characterized by
   electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (in situ STM). The
   Os-complexes were found to display strong tunneling spectroscopic (STS)
   features at the level of resolution of the single molecule while STS
   features of the Co complexes, although clear, were much weaker. The data
   was framed by concise but phenomenological theory of interfacial
   electrochemical electron transfer extended to the electrochemical in
   situ STM configuration. With a view on first-principle insight into the
   in situ STM behavior of robust redox (as opposed to nonredox) molecules,
   we present in this report a density functional theory (DFT) study of the
   complexes in both free and adsorbate state, in either state exposed to
   both stoichiometric counterions and a large assembly of solvent water
   molecules. The oxidation states of the complexes were controlled, first
   by introducing chlorine counter atoms followed by spontaneous attraction
   of electrons from the complexes, also at first in electrostatically
   neutral form. Second, the solvent is found to provide strong dielectric
   screening of this charge transfer process and to be crucial for
   achieving the full chemically meaningful charge separated ionic
   oxidation states. The molecular charge and structure of the complexes in
   the presence of the solvent, are conserved upon adsorption, whereas the
   structural features of the different oxidation states are completely
   lost upon adsorption under vacuum conditions. Detailed microscopic
   insight such as offered by the present study will be important in
   molecular-based approaches to "smart" redox molecules enclosed in in
   situ STM or other nanoscale and single-molecules scale configurations in
   condensed matter environments.

AB We propose thermoelectric devices where a single molecule is connected
   to two metallic zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) via highly
   transparent contacts that allow the injection of evanescent wave
   functions from ZGNRs. Their overlap generates a peak in the electronic
   transmission that is largely insensitive to the type of the short
   conjugated molecule, while ZGNRs additionally suppress hole-like
   contributions to the thermopower. Thus optimized thermopower, together
   with suppression of phonon transport through a ZGNR-molecule-ZGNR
   structure, yields the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT similar to 0.5
   at room temperature and 0.5 < ZT < 2.5 below liquid nitrogen
   temperature. Using density functional theory combined with the
   nonequilibrium Green's function formalism for multiterminal devices, we
   show how the transmission resonance can be manipulated by the voltage
   applied to a third ZGNR top-gate electrode covering the molecule to
   further tune the value of ZT.

   different surfaces of PbSe are considered. Despite experimental

AB Using density functional theory we have studied the adsorption
   properties of different atoms and molecules deposited on a
   stoichiometric, reduced, and oxidized rutile TiO2(110) surface.
   Depending on the oxidation state of the surface, electrons can flow from
   or to the substrate and, therefore, negatively or positively charged
   species are expected. In particular, we have found that a charge
   transfer process from or to the surface always occurs for highly
   electronegative or highly electropositive species, respectively. For
   atoms or molecules with intermediate electron affinity, the direction of
   the charge flow depends on the oxidation state of the rutile surface and
   on the adsorption site. Generally, the charging effect leads to more
   stable complexes. However, the increase in the binding energy of the
   adsorbates is highly dependent on the electronic states of the surface
   prior to the adsorption event. In this work we have analyzed in details
   these mechanisms and we have also established a direct correlation
   between the enhanced binding energy of the adsorbates and the induced

   find the transport to depend on the orientation and lattice matching of

   Bulk lithium vacancies are found to be available and mobile under
   battery charging conditions, and found to pin the Fermi level at the top
   of the anti bonding peroxide pi*(2p(x)) and pi*(2p(y)) levels in the

   reduced transmission, since the anti bonding sigma*(2p(z)) level in the
   Li(2)O(2) conduction band is found to couple strongly to the metal
   substrate and create localized interface states with poor coupling to
   the Li(2)O(2) bulk states. These observations provide a possible

AB The atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide on an OH-terminated
   TiO2(101) anatase surface was studied employing density functional
   theory calculations. The formation of the Al2O3-TiO2 interface during
   the first atomic layer deposition cycle was modeled by studying the
   dissociative adsorption of an Al(CH3)(3) precursor, followed with a
   H2O-pulse reaction step that changes the surface termination.
   Calculations provide evidence for the formation of a discontinuous,
   atomically rough aluminum oxide layer after the first cycle. To explore
   the role of the aluminum oxide layer on adsorption of a ruthenium-based
   N3 dye molecule, various adsorption geometries were investigated.
   Calculations show that even one Al2O3 ALD cycle is enough to block N3
   adsorption on the TiO2. Consequently, N3 anchors to the aluminum oxide
   layer, which increases the dye-TiO2 distance by similar to 2 angstrom,
   changes the adsorption site, and weakens the coupling to TiO2. All these
   factors suppress forward electron injection from the dye molecule to the
   TiO2 conduction band edge. It is, therefore, questionable whether the
   aluminum oxide layer can offer improvements to the conversion efficiency
   in dye-sensitized solar cells.

   submicrometer size particles to nanoparticles. For that, we need to know
   how the refractive index function depends on the cluster size. As a
   first step, we have used time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) calculations having a focus on the shape changes of the
   calculated spectra, which can be related to changes in the refractive
   index function. Starting from the structure of TiO2 molecule for the two
   smallest particles and truncated bulk anatase structure for larger
   particles, the structures for (TiO2)(n) clusters, n = {1, 2, 8, 18, 28,
   38}, have been modeled. After the structure optimization using standard
   density functional theory (DFT) approach, the photoabsorption spectra
   for the optimized particle structures have been calculated by using
   TDDFT calculations. The results show slight evidence of the band gap
   broadening in the case of three out of the smallest particles and strong
   structural dependence of electronic and spectral properties, which can
   partly be related to the transformation of the electron structure, and
   breaking of the crystal symmetry as the size of the particle becomes
   smaller. These findings indicate that in the case of small particles
   their refractive index function can differ from the bulk values, and
   this has to be taken into account in the interpretation of
   light-scattering measurements.

AB We present a theoretical investigation of the hydrogenation of pyrene
   and of the subsequent molecular hydrogen evolution. Using density
   functional theory (DFT) at the GGA-PBE level, the chemical binding of
   atomic hydrogen to pyrene is found to be exothermic by up to 1.6 eV with
   a strong site dependence. The edge C atoms are found most reactive. The
   barrier for the formation of the hydrogen-pyrene bond is small, down to
   0.06 eV. A second hydrogen binds barrierless at many sites. The most
   stable structure of dihydrogenpyrene is more stable by 0.64 eV than
   pyrene plus a molecular hydrogen molecule and a large barrier of 3.7 eV
   for the molecular hydrogen evolution is found. Using a simple
   tight-binding model we demonstrate that the projected density of
   pi-states can be used to predict the most stable binding sites for
   hydrogen atoms and the model is used to investigate the most favorable
   binding sites on more hydrogenated pyrene molecules and on coronene.
   Some of the DFT calculations were complemented with hybrid-DFT (PBE0)
   showing a general agreement between the DFT and hybrid-DFT results. (C)

   structure that arise with the multilayer formation. The calculated

   energy are 4.5 -5.0 angstrom (4.5 - 4.8 angstrom) and 75 - 102 meV/cell
   (93 - 127 meV/cell) in the bilayer (bulk), depending on the choice of
   vdW-DF version. We obtain the corresponding band diagrams using
   calculations in the ordinary generalized gradient approximation for the
   geometries specified by our vdW-DF results, so probing the indirect
   effect of vdW forces on electron behavior. We find significant band-gap
   modifications by up to -1.2 eV (+ 4.0 eV) in various regions of the

AB Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) is a promising spectroscopic tool
   for molecular junctions. The principles in TVS is to find the minimum on
   a Fowler-Nordheim plot where ln(I/V(2)) is plotted against 1/V and
   relate the voltage at the minimum V(min) to the closest molecular level.
   Importantly, V(min) is approximately half the voltage required to see a
   peak in the dI/dV curve. Information about the molecular level position
   can thus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show
   that the molecular level position can be determined at even lower
   voltages, V(min)((alpha)), by finding the minimum of ln(I/V(alpha)) with
   alpha < 2. On the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we
   analyze theoretical ab initio as well as experimental I -V curves and
   show that the voltage required to determine the molecular levels can be
   reduced by similar to 30% as compared to conventional TVS. As for
   conventional TVS, the symmetry/asymmetry of the molecular junction needs
   to be taken into account in order to gain quantitative information. We
   show that the degree of asymmetry may be estimated from a plot of
   V(min)((alpha)) vs alpha.

   para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) ligands is measured in the range of
   0.05-6.2 eV (mid-IR to UV) by a combination of several techniques for
   purified samples in solid and solution phases. The results are compared
   to calculations for a model cluster Au-102(SMe)(44) based on the
   time-dependent density functional theory in the linear-response regime
   and using the known structure of Au-102(p-MBA)(44). The measured and
   calculated molar absorption coefficients in the NIR-vis region are
   comparable, within a factor of 2, in the absolute scale. Several
   characteristic features are observed in the absorption in the range of
   1.5-3.5 eV. The onset of the electronic transitions in the mid-IR region
   is experimentally observed at 0.45 +/- 0.05 eV which compares well with
   the lowest calculated transition at 0.55 eV. Vibrations in the ligand
   layer give rise to fingerprint IR features below the onset of low-energy
   metal-to-metal electronic transitions. Partial exchange of the p-MBA
   ligand to glutathione does not affect the onset of the electronic
   transitions, which indicates that the metal core of the cluster is not
   affected by the ligand exchange. The full spectroscopic characterization
   of the Au-102(p-MBA)(44) reported here for the first time gives
   benchmarks for further studies of manipulation and functionalization of

AB The electronic conductance of a benzene molecule connected to gold
   electrodes via thiol, thiolate, or amino anchoring groups is calculated
   using nonequilibrium Green functions in combination with the fully
   self-consistent GW approximation for exchange and correlation. The
   calculated conductance of benzenedithiol and benzenediamine is one-fifth
   that predicted by standard density functional theory (DFT), in very good
   agreement with experiments. In contrast, the widely studied
   benzenedithiolate structure is found to have a significantly higher
   conductance due to the unsaturated sulfur bonds. These findings suggest
   that more complex gold-thiolate structures where the thiolate anchors
   are chemically passivated by Au adatoms are responsible for the measured
   conductance. Analysis of the energy level alignment obtained with DFT,
   Hartree-Fock, and GW reveals the importance of self-interaction
   corrections (exchange) on the molecule and dynamical screening at the
   metal-molecule interface. The main effect of the GW self-energy is to
   renormalize the level positions; however, its influence on the shape of
   molecular resonances also affects the conductance. Non-self-consistent
   G(0)W(0) calculations, starting from either DFT or Hartree-Fock, yield
   conductance values within 50% of the self-consistent GW results.

AB Quantum interference (QI) in molecular transport junctions can lead to
   dramatic reductions of the electron transmission at certain energies. In
   a recent work [Markussen et al., Nano Lett., 2010, 10, 4260] we showed
   how the presence of such transmission nodes near the Fermi energy can be
   predicted solely from the structure of a conjugated molecule when the
   energies of the atomic p(z) orbitals do not vary too much. Here we relax
   the assumption of equal on-site energies and generalize the graphical
   scheme to molecules containing different atomic species. We use this
   diagrammatic scheme together with tight-binding and density functional
   theory calculations to investigate QI in linear molecular chains and
   aromatic molecules with different side groups. For the molecular chains
   we find a linear relation between the position of the transmission nodes
   and the side group p orbital energy. In contrast, the transmission
   functions of functionalized aromatic molecules generally display a
   rather complex nodal structure due to the interplay between molecular
   topology and the energy of the side group orbital.

AB Electronic structure calculations are a widely used tool in materials
   science and large consumer of supercomputing resources. Traditionally,
   the software packages for these kind of simulations have been
   implemented in compiled languages, where Fortran in its different
   versions has been the most popular choice. While dynamic, interpreted
   languages, such as Python, can increase the efficiency of programmer,
   they cannot compete directly with the raw performance of compiled
   languages. However, by using an interpreted language together with a
   compiled language, it is possible to have most of the productivity
   enhancing features together with a good numerical performance. We have
   used this approach in implementing an electronic structure simulation
   software GPAW using the combination of Python and C programming
   languages. While the chosen approach works well in standard workstations
   and Unix environments, massively parallel supercomputing systems can
   present some challenges in porting, debugging and profiling the
   software. In this paper we describe some details of the implementation
   and discuss the advantages and challenges of the combined Python/C
   approach. We show that despite the challenges it is possible to obtain
   good numerical performance and good parallel scalability with Python
   based software.

   solid oxide fuel cell anodes, adversely affecting the electrochemical
   performance. This study uses density functional theory (DFT) to describe
   the competitive adsorption thermodynamics of H2S and H-2 on Ni(111).
   Unlike previous DFT-based studies on the H2S-H-2-Ni system, a
   vibrational analysis of the adsorbates is performed to calculate the
   thermal corrections to the enthalpy and entropy of the surface species.
   Parallel adsorption reactions of H-2 on Ni explicitly accounting for
   coverage effects of the S and H adatoms on the Ni(111) surface are
   included in the analysis. The resulting equilibrium equations for the
   multiple adsorption/desorption reactions are then solved to calculate
   the S and H coverage over a wide range of T, P-H2S, and P-H2. This study
   illustrates the errors introduced in the predicted S coverage if H-2
   adsorption in parallel with H2S adsorption is neglected or if the
   thermal corrections to the enthalpy and entropy of reaction are not

   grid-based projector-augmented wave density functional theory code,
   GPAW. The defects considered are Ti interstitials, O vacancies, and H
   dopants in the rutile phase of bulk titanium dioxide. We find that by
   applying a sufficiently large value for the Hubbard-U parameter of the
   Ti 3d states, the excess electrons localize spatially at the Ti sites
   and appear as states in the band gap. At U=2.5 eV, the position in
   energy of these gap states are in fair agreement with the experimental
   observations. In calculations with several excess electrons and U=2.5
   eV, all of these end up in gap states that are spatially localized
   around specific Ti atoms, thus effectively creating one Ti3+ ion per
   excess electron. An important result of this investigation is that
   regardless of which structural defect is the origin of the gap states,
   at U=2.5 eV, these states are found to have their mean energies within a
   few hundredths of an eV from 0.94 eV below the conduction band minimum.

   increased interest as an enabling tool for single-molecule electronic
   devices Although various molecular systems have been shown to exhibit QI
   effects and a number of methods have been proposed for its analysis,
   simple guidelines linking the molecular structure to QI effects in the
   phase-coherent transport regime have until now been lacking In the
   present work we demonstrate that QI in aromatic molecules is intimately
   related to the topology of the molecule's pi system and establish a
   simple graphical scheme to predict the existence of QI-induced
   transmission anuresonances The generality of the scheme, which is exact
   for a certain class of tight-binding models, is proved by a comparison
   to first-principles transport calculations for 10 different
   configurations of anthraquinone as well as a set of cross-conjugated
   molecular wires

AB Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) has recently been introduced as a
   spectroscopic tool for molecular junctions where it offers the
   possibility to probe molecular level energies at relatively low bias
   voltages. In this work we perform extensive ab initio calculations of
   the nonlinear current-voltage relations for a broad class of
   single-molecule transport junctions in order to assess the applicability
   and limitations of TVS. We find, that in order to fully utilize TVS as a
   quantitative spectroscopic tool, it is important to consider asymmetries
   in the coupling of the molecule to the two electrodes. When this is
   taken properly into account, the relation between the transition voltage
   and the energy of the molecular orbital closest to the Fermi level
   closely follows the trend expected from a simple, analytical model.
