Python API and CLI
------------------

Use the :func:`hyperfine_parameters` function or the CLI tool::

    $ python3 -m gpaw.hyperfine --help

.. autofunction:: hyperfine_parameters

For details, see :doi:`Peter E. Bl√∂chl <10.1103/PhysRevB.62.6158>` and
:doi:`Oleg V. Yazyev et al. <10.1103/PhysRevB.71.115110>`.

The results should be divided by the net mangetic moments averaged over an entire supercell.
If one wants to calculate the localized HF effects on an atom or group of atoms in an anti-ferromagnetic material, one needs to divide the HF constants with the average magnetic moment of that atom or group of atoms.
As, an anti-ferromagnetic system, overall should have a net magnetic moment of zero.


G-factors
---------

Here is a list of g-factors (from Wikipedia_):

Hydrogen 21 cm line
-------------------

Here is how to calculate the famous hydrogen spectral line of 21 cm:

.. literalinclude:: hyperfine_21.py
    :end-before: assert

The output will be ``23.2 cm``.
It's slightly off because the LDA spin-density at the position of the hydrogen
nucleus is a bit too low (should be `1/\pi` in atomic units).
