AB Ab initio calculations of the loss function of potassium-intercalated
   and electron-loaded bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes yield a
   channeled-charge-carrier plasmon without perpendicular dispersion.
   Experimentally, we probe the momentum-dependent loss function of thin
   bundles consisting of only a few potassium-intercalated single-walled
   carbon nanotubes by angle-resolved electron-energy-loss spectroscopy and
   confirm this intrinsic channeling. The charge-carrier-plasmon energy is
   via in situ intercalation and is tunable in the near-visible
   infrared-energy range from 0.85 to 1.15 eV.

AB Linear-response time-dependent density functional theory is used to
   investigate the relation between molecular bonding and surface plasmons
   for the model system H/Ag(111). We employ an orbital-dependent
   exchange-correlation functional to obtain a correct description of the
   Ag 3d band, which is crucial to avoid overscreening the plasmon by the
   s-d interband transitions. For the clean surface, this approach
   reproduces the experimental plasmon energies and dispersion to within
   0.15 eV. Adsorption of hydrogen shifts and damps the Ag(111) surface
   plasmon and induces a new peak in the loss function at 0.6 eV below the
   Ag(111) plasmon peak. This feature originates from interband transitions
   between states located on the hydrogen atoms and states on the Ag
   surface atoms.

AB We calculate the potential energy surfaces for graphene adsorbed on
   Cu(111), Ni(111), and Co(0001) using density functional theory and the
   random phase approximation (RPA). For these adsorption systems covalent
   and dispersive interactions are equally important and while commonly
   used approximations for exchange-correlation functionals give inadequate
   descriptions of either van der Waals or chemical bonds, RPA accounts
   accurately for both. It is found that the adsorption is a delicate
   competition between a weak chemisorption minimum close to the surface
   and a physisorption minimum further from the surface.
