Time-propagation TDDFT with LCAO : Theory and usage
===================================================

This page documents the use of time-propagation TDDFT in :ref:`LCAO
mode <lcao>`. The implementation is described in [#Kuisma2015]_.

Real time propagation of LCAO-functions
=======================================

In real time LCAO-TDDFT approach, the time-dependent wave functions are
represented using localized basis sets as

.. math::

  \tilde{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{r},t) = \sum_{\mu} C_{\mu i}(t) \tilde{\phi}^{\mu}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}^\mu).

The TD-Kohn-Sham equation in PAW formalism can be written as

.. math::

  \left[ \widehat T^\dagger \left( -i \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t} + \hat H_{\rm KS}(t) \right) \widehat T \right]  \tilde{\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)} = 0.

Using these equations, following matrix equation can be derived for LCAO wave
function coefficients

.. math::
  {\rm i}\mathbf{S} \frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{C}(t)}{{\rm d}t} = \mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{C}(t).

In current implementation in GPAW, C, S and H are full matrices, which are
parellelized using ScaLAPACK. Currently semi implicit Crank-Nicholson method
(SICN) is used to propagate wave functions. For wave functions at time t, one
propagates the system forward using H(t) and solving a linear equation

.. math::

  \left( \mathbf{S} + {\rm i} \mathbf{H}(t) {\rm d}t / 2 \right) \mathbf{C}'(t+{\rm d}t) = \left( \mathbf{S} - {\rm i} \mathbf{H}(t) {\rm d}t / 2 \right) \mathbf{C}(t)

Using the predicted wave functions at C'(t+dt), the Hamiltonian H'(t+dt) is
calculated and the Hamiltonian at middle of the time step is estimated as

.. math::

   \mathbf{H}(t+{\rm d}t/2) = (\mathbf{H}(t) + \mathbf{H}'(t+{\rm d}t)) / 2

With the improved Hamiltonian, have functions are again propagated from t to t+dt

.. math::

  \left( \mathbf{S} + {\rm i} \mathbf{H}(t+{\rm d}t/2) {\rm d}t / 2 \right) \mathbf{C}(t+{\rm d}t) = \left( \mathbf{S} - {\rm i} \mathbf{H}(t+{\rm d}t/2) {\rm d}t / 2 \right) \mathbf{C}(t)

This procedure is repeated using time step of 5-40as and for 500-2000 times to
obtain time evolution of electrons.

Usage
=====

Create LCAOTDDFT object like a GPAW calculator::

 >>> from gpaw.lcaotddft import LCAOTDDFT
 >>> td_calc = LCAOTDDFT(setups={'Na':'1'}, basis='dzp', xc='LDA', h=0.3, nbands=1,
                         convergence={'density':1e-7},
                         poissonsolver=PoissonSolver(eps=1e-20, remove_moment=1+3+5))

Important points are:

 * Use always compatible setups and basis sets.
 * Grid spacing is only used to calculate the Hamiltonian matrix and therefore larger grid than usual can be used.
 * Completely unoccupied bands should be left out of the calculation, since they are not needed.
 * Convergence of density should be few orders of magnitude more accurate than in ground state calculations.
 * Convergence of poisson solver should be at least 1e-14, but 1e-20 does not hurt (this is the quadratic error).
 * One should use multipole corrected poisson solver in any TDDFT run. For more advanced poisson solvers, see :ref:`advancedpoisson`.

Perform a regular ground state calculation, the get the ground state wave functions::

 >>> atoms.set_calculator(td_calc)
 >>> atoms.get_potential_energy()

If you wish to save here, write the wave functions also::

 >>> td_calc.write('Na2.gpw', mode='all')

The calculation proceeds as in grid mode. We kick the system to x-direction and propagate with 10as time steps for 500 steps::

 >>> td_calc.absorption_kick([1e-5, 0.0, 0.0])
 >>> td_calc.propagate(10, 500, out='Na2.dm')

The spectrum is obtained in same manner, as in grid propagation mode.

General notes about basis sets
==============================

In time-propagation LCAO-TDDFT, the basis sets are in even more crucial role than
in a ground state LCAO calculation. It is required, that basis set can represent
both the occupied (electrons) and relevant unoccupied states (holes) adequately.
Custom basis sets for the time propagation should be generated according to ones
need, and then benchmarked.

**Irrespective of the basis sets you choose, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, benchmark LCAO
results with respect to grid time-propagation code** on a largest system
possible. For example, one can create a prototype system, which consists of
similar atom species with similar roles than in the parent system, but small
enough to calculate with grid propagation mode. For example, in relevance of benchmarking the basis set, see Fig. 4 and 5 of [#Kuisma2015]_.

After these remarks, we describe two sets of basis sets that can be used as a
starting point for choosing suitable basis set for your needs. Namely,
:ref:`pvalence basis sets` and :ref:`coopt basis sets`.

.. _pvalence basis sets:

p-valence basis sets
--------------------

The so-called p-valence basis sets are constructed by replace the p-type
polarization function of the default basis sets with bound unoccupied p-type
orbital and its split-valence complement. Such basis sets correspond to the ones
used in Ref. [#Kuisma2015]_. These basis sets significantly improve density of
states of unoccupied states.

The p-valence basis sets can be easily obtained for appropriate elements with ``gpaw-install-setups`` tool with following options:
``gpaw-install-setups --basis --version=pvalence``.
See :ref:`installationguide_setup_files` for basis set installation.
It is again reminded that these basis sets
are not thoroughly tested and **it is essential to benchmark the performance of
the basis sets for your application**.

.. _coopt basis sets:

Completeness-optimized basis sets
---------------------------------

A systematic approach for improving the basis sets can be obtained with the
so-called completeness-optimization approach. This approach is used in Ref.
[#Rossi2015]_ to generate basis set series for TDDFT calculations of copper,
silver, and gold clusters.

For further details of the basis sets, as well as their construction and
performance, see [#Rossi2015]_. For convenience, these basis sets can be easily
obtained with ``gpaw-install-setups`` tool with following options:
``gpaw-install-setups --basis --version=coopt``.
See :ref:`installationguide_setup_files` for basis set installation.
Finally, it is again
emphasized that when using the basis sets, **it is essential to benchmark their
suitability for your application**.


Parallelization
===============

LCAO-TDDFT is parallelized using ScaLAPACK. It runs without scalapack, but in this case only single core is used for linear alrebra.

 * ScaLAPACK can be enabled by specifying --sl_default=N,M,64 in command line.
 * Alternatively, use parallization={'sl_default':(N,M,64)}.
 * It is necessary that N*M equals to total number of cores and max(N,M)*64 < nbands. 64 can be changed to 16 if necessary.
 * Apart from parallelization of linear algrebra, normal domain and band parallelizations can be used. As in LCAO-mode usually, use band parallelization to reduce memory consumption.

Timing

TODO: add ``ParallelTimer`` example


Advanced tutorial - Plasmon resonance of silver cluster
=======================================================

One should think what type of transitions is there of interest, and make sure
that the basis set can represent such Kohn-Sham electron and hole wave functions.
The first transitions in silver cluster will be `5s \rightarrow 5p` like. We
require 5p orbitals in the basis set, and thus, we must generate a custom basis
set.

Here is how to generate a double-zeta basis set with 5p orbital in valence for
Silver for GLLB-SC potential. We will use GPAW 0.8 setup definition, since semi-core p states are not relevant here.

.. literalinclude:: lcaotddft_basis.py

We calculate the icosahedral Ag55 cluster: :download:`ag55.xyz`

This code uses ScaLAPACK parallelization with 64 cores.

.. literalinclude:: lcaotddft_ag55.py

Code runs for approximately two wall hours. The resulting spectrum shows already emerging plasmonic excitation around 4 eV.
For more details, see [#Kuisma2015]_.

Induced density
===============

Plotting the induced density is especially interesting in case of plasmon resonances. As an example, we calculate a dummy Na8 wire and write density to a file on every iteration.
There is certain advantages in writing the density on every iteration instead of using the predefined frequencies and on-fly Fourier transformation: only one TDDFT run is required as any frequency can be analysed as a post processing operation.
Hard disk requirements are large, but tolerable (1-100GB) in usual cases.

.. literalinclude:: lcaotddft_induced.py

Files with extensions .sG and .asp are created, where .sG contains the density in coarse grid and .asp contains the atomic density matrix. With these, it is possible to reconstruct the full density.
This can now be fourier transformed at desired frequency. Here, we look from the produced spectrum file that plasmonic peak, and perform Fourier transform at that frequency.

.. literalinclude:: lcaotddft_analyse.py

Two cube files are created, one for sin (imag) and cos (real) transform at the frequency. Usually, one is interested in the absorbing part i.e. imaginary part. Below is visualized the plasmon resonance
in Na8 wire. In the current form, these cube files contain just the pseudo part of density.

Advanced tutorial - large organic molecule
==========================================

General notes
-------------

On large organic molecules, on large conjugated systems, there will `\pi \rightarrow \pi^*`,
`\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^*`. These states consists of only
the valence orbitals of carbon, and they are likely by quite similar few eV's
below and above the fermi lavel. These is thus a reason to believe that these
states are well described with hydrogen 1s and carbon 2s and 2p valence orbitals
around the fermi level.

Here, we will calculate a small and a large organic molecule with lcao-tddft.

**TODO**

Kohn-Sham decomposition of the transition density matrix
========================================================

Soon it will be possible to analyse the origin of the transitions the same way as is commonly done in Casida-based codes.
The LCAO basis will be transformed to electron-hole basis of the Kohn-Sham system.
