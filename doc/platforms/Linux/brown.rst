Brown University (ccv.brown.edu)
================================

GPAW is centrally installed and can be installed per-user on 'Oscar',
Brown University's Supercomputer run by the Center for Computation and
Visualization (CCV_).
We keep detailed instructions, as well as customization files and submit
scripts in a dedicated repository called brown-gpaw_.
In this repository, you should be able to find instructions to use and/or
install GPAW for the versions currently available on CCV.
