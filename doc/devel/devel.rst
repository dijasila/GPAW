Development
===========

GPAW development can be done by anyone! Just take a look at the
:ref:`todolist` list and find something that suits your talents!

The primary source of information is still the :ref:`manual` and
:ref:`documentation`, but as a developer you might need additional
information which can be found here. For example the :ref:`code_overview`.

As a developer, you should subscribe to all GPAW related :ref:`mailing_lists`.
We would also like to encourage you to join our channel for :ref:`irc`.

Now you are ready to to perfom a :ref:`developer_installation` and
start development!

.. note --- below toctrees are defined in separate files to make sure that the line spacing doesn't get very large (which is of course a bad hack)

Development topics
==================

When committing significant changes to the code, remember to add a
note in the :ref:`releasenotes` at the top (current svn) - the version
to become the next release.
