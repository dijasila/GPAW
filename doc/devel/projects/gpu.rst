Stanford/SUNCAT Effort
======================

(Lin Li, Jun Yan, Christopher O'Grady)

We believe that GPAW has two areas where significant improvement would
be very helpful: ease-of-convergence and performance.

We think the first of those is going to be significantly improved (for
small systems that are largely of interest to SUNCAT) by the addition
of the planewave-basis mode.  To complement the GPU grid-mode work of
Samuli Hakala et. al. at CSC we are seeing if it is possible to
significantly improve the planewave performance (and
performance-per-dollar) of GPAW using GPUs.  We are also using GPUs to
see if the Random Phase Approximation performance can be improved.
