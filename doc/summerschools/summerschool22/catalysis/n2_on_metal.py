Catalysis: Dissociative adsorbtion of N<sub>2</sub> on a metal surface
======================================================================

This is the rate limiting step for ammonia synthesis.

**Scientific disclaimer:**  These calculations are done on a flat surface.
In reality, the process takes place at the foot of an atomic step on the
surface.  Doing calculations on this more realistic system would be too slow
for these exercises.  For the same reason, we use a metal slab with only two
layers, a realistic calculation would require the double.

Setting up the metal surface
----------------------------

Ru crystalises in the hcp structure with a lattice constants a = 2.706 Å and
c = 4.282 Å.  It is often better to use the lattice constants corresponding
to the DFT variant used (here PBE with PAW).  We get this from
http://oqmd.org.

We model the surface by a 2 layer slab of metal atoms, and add 5Å vacuum on
each side.

We visualize the system with ASE GUI, so you can check that everything looks
right.  This pops up a new window.

To optimise the slab we need a calculator. We use the GPAW calculator in

convergence with respect to the cutoff energy and k-point sampling should
always be checked - see `Convergence.ipynb`for more information on how this
can be done. For this exercise an energy cutoff of 350eV and 4x4x1 k-point
mesh is chosen to give reasonable results with a limited computation time.

Adsorbing the molecule

Now we adsorb the molecule on top of one of the Ru atoms.

Here, it would be natural to just add the molecule to the slab, and minimize.
However, that takes 45 minutes to an hour to converge, **so we cheat to speed
up the calculation.**

The main slowing-down comes from the relaxation of the topmost metal atom
where the N<sub>2</sub> molecule binds, this atom moves a quarter of an
Ångström out.  Also, the binding length of the molecule changes when it is
adsorbed, so we build a new molecule with a better starting guess.
