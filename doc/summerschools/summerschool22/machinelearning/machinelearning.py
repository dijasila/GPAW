# Introduction

In this series of excercises, you will learn how to work with ase databases,
and do some simple machine learning for electronic structure properties. The
driving idea is to predict complex properties of compounds from simpler
properties, under the slogan that the fastest calculation is the one you
don't have to run. We start by importing some relevant packages for
scientific python and `ase` in particular.

In the current directory, there is an `ase` database file called 'organometal.db'.
It contains information about organometallic perovskites, and the goal is to
predict properties for these. Along with the perovskite compounds, there are
also reference calculations of the elements in their standard states. We
start by connecting to the database (more info on the `ase db` module can be
found [here](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html#module-ase.db)),
and inspecting a single row:
"""

When doing any kind of data analysis, the first step is always to become familiar with the data in question, on a basic level. The `select()` method of the database applies a query to the database and returns an iterator of all the rows matching that query. To select all rows with a user of `einstein`, we would type `db.select(user='einstein')`. To select all rows with a gllbsc direct gap greater than 0.5 eV, we would type `db.select('gllbsc_dir_gap>0.5')`.
Counting the number of hits can be be done using `db.count(key=value)` for some key-value pair.

# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions. The crucial idea is that the computer should be able to improve its performance at a given task as we give it more information. A tutorial on machine learning in general can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html).

In this workbook we will be carrying  out a supervised learning task, where we attempt to predict a particular (known) attribute of a given structure, based on other attributes of the structure. This can be useful if it allows us to use easy-to-calculate properties to say something about quantities which are difficult to calculate. This approach to learning, where we attempt to find a map $f$ from the attributes, $X$, of our data to some target property, $y$, is known as supervised learning. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) for more general information on the topic.

The two most important ingredients in the supervised learning approach are which attributes of the data we feed into the machine learning process, and which model we then apply on the data.

## Input Vectors

To start, we use a one-hot encoding of each of the different categories of data as our input vector. Later, you will be asked to see if you can find a better set of features to describe the data.

"""
In a one-hot encoding, assign the data into different categorical classes, and then have one feature for each class. For example, there are four different symmetries in the data, so the first four features of the input vector describe which symmetry the material lies in. A '1' in a given position indicates that the material falls into that class, while a '0' indicates that it does not.

As an example, we apply the encoding to the first few rows of the database with cubic symmetry, and show the formula and the name:

## Modelling

With the input and output in place, we are ready to do the initial machine
learning. All supervised machine learning processes do the following, in a
generalized sense:

- Select a general functional form for the model, parametrized in
  a suitable way.

- Find a loss function to evaluate the performance of a given set
  of parameters.

- Optimize the parameters of the model to minimize the loss.

All the hard work is usually in the last step, since for complex models the
relationship between the parameters and the loss function can be very
difficult. However, for simpler models, we can sometimes find a closed form
for the loss function.

The very simplest class of machine learning models are just generalized
linear models, where the target, $y$, is assumed to be a linear function of
the input variables. You can read more about them
[here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares). For a
linear function, we guess a functional form $f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_n w_n x_n = \mathbf w \cdot \mathbf x$, and seek to optimize the weight vector, $\mathbf w$.

If we choose the loss function
$$ L = \sum_i (f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i))^2 = \sum_{i} \left(\sum_{n}w_i x_{in} - y_i\right)^2 $$
, we will recover ordinary least squares regression. In matrix terms, the loss corresponds to the norm $ L = \left\| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} \right\|^2$.
The loss is minimal when the derivative with respect to the weight vector is zero. A bit of
rearranging gives that this is true when
$$ \mathbf w = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}) ^ {-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y} $$

Here $\mathbf w$ is an (n_features, 1) weight vector that we are trying to
find, $\mathbf{X}$ is an (n_samples , n_features) matrix of our observed
inputs and $\mathbf y$ is the (n_samples, 1) output vector that we are trying
to predict.

Write a function `fit`, which takes as input a matrix $\mathbf X$, and a
target vector $\mathbf y$, and performs this linear regression, returning the
list of weights and an estimate of the loss for this list of weights.

Hint: useful functions are `np.dot()` and `np.linalg.inv()`, which calculate
the dot product and inverse, respectively, of their arguments.

One of the assumptions made in the derivation of the linear model is that the matrix $(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})$ is invertible. Unfortunately, that's not true for our case. That's because of the encoding we have chosen, which means for example that for any row, the first four columns must sum to one. The fourth column can therefore always be written as 1 - the sum of the first three.

We can alleviate this by adding a regularization term to our loss function, which penalises large weights. The new loss is can then be written as  $L = \left\| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 + \alpha \left\| w\right\|^2$. Luckily, there is still a closed-form solution for this, namely $\mathbf w = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} + \alpha \mathbf{I}) ^ {-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}$. Modify your `fit()` function to take an extra argument $\alpha$, and apply regularization to the original problem. Does everything work now? Do the weights of your model make sense?

Scikit-learn provides a `score()` method for each model, which evaluates how good the fit is.

To truly compare between models, we should ideally train on some data, and evaluate the model on a different set of data.

The way to do this is by cross-validation, where the data is randomly split into a number of buckets, and for each bucket, the model is trained on all the other data, and then tested on the data in the bucket. Since the data might have a meaningful order in the database, it is important that the assignment of the data to each bucket is done at random. This is accomplished by the `shuffle` argument to `KFold`.

This approach of evaluating the performance of a model is very general and can also be used to optimize the so-called hyperparameters of a model, such as the regularization parameter $\alpha$. Here, we will not optimize $\alpha$, but only compare the performance of the `alpha=0` and `alpha=0.5` model. The score has been chosen so that the closer it is to 1, the better.

When searching for new materials, we would like to find only stable materials. These should have a negative heat of formation, and be in the most stable symmetry class of the four we are considering. The model we have just made will tell us whether a given compound has a negative heat of formation, but it won't tell us whether a different symmetry class would have a lower energy.

Predicting which symmetry class of the four is most stable for a given composition is a typical example of a classification problem: we would like to map a given composition, to which of the four symmetry classes is most stable. We start by creating the new output vector corresponding to our data. The output vector should have dimensions (n_compositions, 1), where n_compositions is the total number of different possible compositions without considering symmetries. For each composition, the output should indicate which of the symmetries in the database gives the lowest energy. An idea could be to reuse the `symmetry map` from further up.

For the input vector, we can use the same one as before, only with the first four entries (corresponding to the symmetry class) removed.

You should start by creating the target vector, which describes which symmetry is most stable for each composition:

## Improving the input vector

There is much more information we could include in the input vector, which might increase our predictive power of our model. An example could be the covalent radius of tin vs lead, or of the halogens, which will tend to increase or decrease the lattice constant of the whole crystal, and hence the energy. The covalent radii are available in `ase.data`, and can be imported as `from ase.data import covalent_radii`. Another example could be the electronegativities of the halogens, which will play a role in the character of the bonds. The mulliken electronegativities of chlorine, bromine and iodine are 8.3, 7.59 and 6.76 respectively

Start by redoing a basic examination of the data: plot the band gap and heats of formation against some of the quantities you might add, and see if there is any correlation. For the quantities that do have a correlation, try adding them to the input vector, and see which (if any) result in an improved model for either the heat of formation, the relative energetic ordering of the symmetry classes, or the band gap.

## Improving the models

Most phenomena we encounter don't have nice linear relationships between inputs and outputs. We model nonlinear relationships in two different ways: we either introduce nonlinearity in our features, or in our model. The first
is known as feature engineering, and requires a good method. The second makes optimizing the parameters of our model slightly more difficult, as we can lose many of the nice properties of the linear model, such as the closed-form solution.

Here we will focus on gaussian process regression as a case study. You can read more about it [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html#gaussian-process). This lets us fit nonlinear functions and also provides a confidence interval indicating how well the machine is doing.

Similar to the `linear_regression`, we can import it from `sklearn` and create an example of the model with `model = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=YYY)`, where `YYY` is the kernel used. As a start, we should use a radial basis function, which is also available from `sklearn`. As usual, the model has a `fit()` and a `predict()` method, which sets the parameters of the model, and tries to predict outputs based on inputs.

The model we have chosen is very dependent on the length scale we set for the kernel, and it is not given that the value chosen above (0.1) is a good choice. The fact that we have a score of 1.0 is an indication that we may be overfitting. The trick to selecting the best value of this parameter is again cross-validation. We can loop over different possible values of the hyperparameter to make different classes of models, and then evaluate the cross-validation score of each to see which performs best. Try this!

Ideally you should find that length scales of ~1.0 perform best according to this scoring metric.

You should note that there is a problem with using the Cross-validation scores we compute here to evaluate the performance of a given set of hyperparameters, which is very similar to the original problem of overfitting.

* It has a negative heat of formation
* The cubic symmetry is the most stable for this composition class (due to computational cost of the other symmetry types)
* It has a band gap of approximately 1.5 eV

It might not be possible to find a material that fulfills all, so try to find one, where the band gap of the cubic symmetry structure is close to 1.5 eV.

Standard DFT seriously underestimates the band gap. We thus use a more accurate method which includes the calculation of the derivative discontinuity, called GLLBSC.
