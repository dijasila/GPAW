# Introduction to Python and ASE and some useful libraries

Python is a programming language that has become a de-facto standard within scientific programming.  It is also very popular for teaching programming and computer science. One of the advantages of the language is that it is relatively easy to read and understand pre-existing code.

### Python Notebooks

We are working with Python notebooks.  A notebook is split into cells (this is a text cell, most cells contain a block of Python code).  You can execute a cell by pressing Shift+Enter.  You can edit a text cell by doubleclicking it.  You can change the type of a cell on the menu bar above, use "Markup" for text and "Code" for Python code.  There are also buttons for adding and removing cells.  Cells can be split into two (or merged) on the Edit menu.

## Importing the necesary modules

A lot of helper packages for e.g. numeric calculations, plotting, atomic-scale simulations etc are available in Python, but you need to "import" the module to get access to it (you also often need to install it, but that has been taken care of here).

A few packages support special integration with Notebooks, this includes the plotting package ``matplotlib``, where the integration is enabled with a notebook-specific command starting with the ``%`` character.

You can add comments to Python code by using the ``#`` character.

## Variables and data types

In python, variables contain data of different types, such as numbers or text strings.  You can print a variable with the ``print()`` function:
"""

# %%
a = 42
mypi = 3.14
b = "some text"
print(a)
print("Pi is approximately", mypi)
print(b)

The usual mathematical operations are possible.  The operator for exponentiation is the double star.

# NumPy
#### NumPy arrays are heavely used in [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
ASE makes heavy use of an extension to Python called NumPy. The NumPy module
defines an `ndarray` type that can hold large arrays of uniform
multidimensional numeric data. An array is similar to a `list` or a `tuple`,

## Nitrogen on copper
### Exercise of the relaxation of a molecule on a surface
This section gives a quick (and incomplete) overview of what ASE can do.

We will calculate the adsorption energy of a nitrogen molecule on a copper
surface. This is done by calculating the total energy for the isolated slab
and for the isolated molecule. The adsorbate is then added to the slab and
relaxed, and the total energy for this composite system is calculated. The
adsorption energy is obtained as the sum of the isolated energies minus the
energy of the composite system.

You can read more about the optimizers in ASE here:
https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/optimize.html

#### 1. Try to go through the script so you understand what is going on
#### 2. Calculate the adsorption energy of N2 on a 4x4x2 fcc111 slab (result= 0.324 eV)
#### 3. Try a couple of different optimizers and see which one is the fastest
