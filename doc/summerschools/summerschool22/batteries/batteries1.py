## Day 2 - Li intercalation energy
"""

# %%
"""
Today we will calculate the energy cost/gain associated with intercalating a lithium atom into graphite using approaches at different levels of theory. After today you should be able to:

- Setup structures and do relaxations using ASE and GPAW.
- Discuss which level of theory is required to predict the Li intercalation energy and why?

The Li intercalation reaction is:
$$Li(s) + C_x^{graphite} \rightarrow LiC_x$$
and the intercalation energy will then be
$$E_{Li@graphite} = E_{LiC_x} - (E_{Li(s)} + E_{C_x^{graphite}})$$
Where $x$ is the number of Carbon atoms in your computational cell.

We will calculate these energies using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with different exchange-correlation functionals. Graphite is characterised by graphene layers with strongly bound carbon atoms in hexagonal rings and weak long-range van der Waals interactions between the layers.

In the sections below we will calculate the lowest energy structures of each compound. This is needed to determine the intercalation energy.

To try some of the methods that we are going to use we will start out by utilizing the interatomic potential [EMT](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/emt.html) (Effective Medium Theory) calculator.

Initially we will calculate the C-C distance and interlayer spacing in graphite in a two step procedure.

Now we need to calculate the energy of Li metal. We will use the same strategy as for graphite, i.e. first determine the lattice constant, then use the energy of that structure. This time though you will have to do most of the work.

Some hints:
1. The crystal structure of Li metal is shown in the image above. That structure is easily created with one of the functions in the [ase.build](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/build/build.html) module
2. A k-point density of approximately 2.4 points / Angstrom will be sufficient
3. The DFTD3 correction is done _a posteriori_, this means the calculator should be created a little differently, see [the second example here](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/dftd3.html#examples)
4. See also the [equation of state module](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/eos.html)
