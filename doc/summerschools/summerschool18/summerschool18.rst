Summer school exercises in Jupyter notebooks
============================================

The Summer School includes a number of projects, which are partly
formulated as Jupyter Notebooks.  In a Jupyter Notebook you are running the
calculations on the DTU central computing facilities, but the output is
displayed in your local browser.

**The instructions and notebooks have been moved and updated for the
Summer School 2022.**
